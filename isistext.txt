In fact, it was characterized in con-trast to this by a frank, early warning of the con-sequence of deviation and opposition to the truth.Allah ta™˚l˚ said: {And We had certainly sent N˛h to his people, [saying], ﬁIndeed, I am to you a clear warner. That you not worship except Al-lah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.ﬂ} [H˛d: 25-26]Ash-Shawk˚n˝ (rahimahull˚h) says, ﬁThe sen-tence {Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day} is explanatory. It means: ‚I warned you against worshipping other than Allah be-cause I fear for you™. This sentence contains a true warning. Furthermore, the painful day referred to is the Day of Judgment or the day of the ˙ood.ﬂThe word ﬁorﬂ in Ash-Shawk˚n˝™s state-ment above undoubtedly combines both items mentioned. This is because the punishment prom-ised by N˛h (‚alayhis-sal˚m) includes both the punishment of Hellˆre on the Day of Judgment, and the punishment of drowning in the ˙ood in this duny˚. As a result, his people were ultimately aˇicted by both punishments. Allah ta™˚l˚ said: {Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides Allah [any] helpers} [N˛h: 25] .What gives the issue further clarity is that when the con˙ict erupted between N˛h and his people, and the day of the ˙ood drew closer, the threat in N˛h™s tone towards his people increased. In fact, he entirely abandoned the tone of debate that they were accustomed to, especially after being informed through revelation that no one else from among his people would believe from that day forward apart from those who had already be-lieved.From amongst the threats he made to his people is that mentioned in the following statement of Al-lah ta™˚l˚: {And he constructed the ship, and when-PART 2:7ever an assembly of the eminent of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, ﬁIf you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule. And you are going to know who will get a punishment that will disgrace him [on earth] and upon whom will descend an endur-ing punishment [in the Hereafter]ﬂ} [H˛d: 38-39].CONTEMPLATING THE VERSESThose who ponder this verse will see that it destroys the methodology claiming people should be given choice. The verse also contains enmity and a warning of a punishment that will beˆt their actions. Rather, this harsh tone of warning from the leader crushes the towers and foundations built by the theorizers for their new ﬁfreedom of choiceﬂ da™wah. For the threat of punishment and humiliation, in their view, is not a political or da™wah tool that is suitable for our times, nor does it further our goals Œ as they claim. Rather the contrary, it™s an indication of the weakness of one™s argument in their view. So the essence and implication of their state-ment is to accuse the Prophet of Allah, N˛h, of turning to the weaker means and abandoning a more superior and e˘ective tool.Then the ˙ood came, the ark was saved and it landed on Al-J˛d˝. The callers to the meth-odology of ﬁfree choiceﬂ never contemplated the actual wisdom as to why the ˙ood of N˛h (‚alayhis-sal˚m) became such a famous event, a report that reached the level of mutaw˚tir (con-veyed by such a large number of narrators that it™s inconceivable they agreed upon a lie), and a parable frequently referred to even until this era. Nor did they contemplate the fact that the mountain known as Al-J˛d˝ is a promi-nent symbol in human history, nor the fact that the ark of N˛h (‚alayhis-sal˚m) is still a target of excavation by archaeologists from all over the world. So they contradict-ed themselves and didn™t succeed in har-monizing between the result of their poli-tics on one hand, and between commonly known and established scientiˆc facts, historical relics, and social customs on the other. In fact, the people™s faith in these truths Œ in spite of their di˘ering creeds Œ reached the extent that a wealthy chris-tian businessman named Daniel McGivern was prepared to invest $900,000 to send a team of explorers to investigate a site be-PART 3:PART 4 :8ARTICLElieved to be the location of the ark of N˛h (‚alay-his-sal˚m). All this was only because of a decree of Allah mentioned in His book, which He brought to pass concerning the ark. He decreed that the ark would remain as a prominent sign in the lives of the people.He ta™˚l˚ said: {But We saved him and the com-panions of the ship, and We made it a sign for the worlds} [Al-‚Ankab˛t: 15].At-T˚hir Ibn ‚˜sh˛r says: ﬁIn His statement {And We made it a sign for the creation}, the pronoun ﬁitﬂ refers to the ark. Allah made the ark a sign by making it evidence for the occurrence of the ˙ood that punished those who rejected His messengers. So the ark became a manifest sign in the eras of all the nations to whom messengers were sent after N˛h, serving as a warning to the disbelievers and as clear ev-idence for the believers. And Allah caused the re-mains of the ark to survive up until the ˆrst gen-erations of the Muslim Ummah. It is reported in Sah˝h Al-Bukh˚r˝ that Qat˚dah said, ﬁThe remains of the ark were on Al-J˛d˝ and were seen by the ˆrst generations of this Ummah.ﬂ It is said that they remained there up until the beginning of the ‚Abb˚s˝ state and were then swept away by ice. Al-J˛d˝ was located near B˚qird˚, a village in Jaz˝rat Ibn ‚Umar in Mosul, east of Dijlah. Allah says in S˛rat Al-Qamar: {AND WE LEFT IT AS A SIGN, SO IS THERE ANY WHO WILL REMEMBER?}[ AL-QAMAR:15 ]ﬁThe reason Allah said {a sign for the creation}          which includes all inhabitants of the earth, is ˆrstly, that anyone who doesn™t see the remains of N˛h™s ark still sees other ships and thus re-members the ark of N˛h, and the fact that it was constructed due to revelation from Allah in order to save N˛h and anyone else whom Allah wished to save. Secondly, it™s because the people resid-ing in the town of the ark keep narrating its story and it keeps being passed on, such that it reach-es the level of mutaw˚tir (conveyed by such a large number of narrators that it™s inconceivable that they agreed upon a lie)ﬂ  [At-Tahr˝r Wat-Tan-w˝r, 20:223].9THE FLOOD IS A REFUTATION OF THE PACIFISTSHad the proponents of choice contemplated all this, they would have realized that the ˙ood was a clear sign of the falseness of giving choice between truth and falsehood in da™wah. For the ˙ood was the result and consequence of oppos-ing the truth, and evidence that anyone who re-jected the truth would be punished in the duny˚ before the Hereafter and would not have any choice in that regards. They would have also re-alized that the mountain was the sign of protec-tion and safety from the punishment for those who believed and followed the truth, and that the ark would always be a witness to two import-ant facts. The ˆrst is that only those who agreed with and followed the truth would be saved from the punishment in the duny˚, in contrast to those who opposed it. The second is that in every time and place, those who are saved from the punish-ment are a small group, whereas the majority are destroyed.Rather, if one were to think that N˛h (‚alay-his-sal˚m) didn™t know about the ˙ood before its arrival, he would be accusing himself of ignorance before attributing it to the Prophet of Allah, N˛h. And if one were to think that N˛h knew about the ˙ood and completely concealed it from the people of his time so that he could continue to be characterized by the methodology of choice, and avoid the methodology of intellectual ter-rorism, he would be accusing the Prophet N˛h of tricking and deceiving those whom he was sent to in order to preserve his image before them Œ and N˛h is completely innocent of such. Never mind the fact that the Qur™an makes it clear that he issued the threat of punishment in response to the mocking he received from his people as he was building the ark.Allah informed His prophet N˛h that the punishment awaiting his people after their disobedience was for them to be drowned, as per His statement:{And construct the ship under Our observa-tion and Our inspiration and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are [to be] drowned} [H˛d: 37].The gist of the issue is that the methodol-ogy of letting the people choose between truth and falsehood was not from the Proph-et N˛h™s manner of dealing with his people. He didn™t say to them, for example: ﬁI have come to you with the truth, and your lead-ers are calling you to falsehood, so you are free to choose whether to follow me or to follow your leaders.ﬂ In fact, he didn™t even say anything to the e˘ect of: ﬁIf you follow me then you would be correct, and if you follow your leaders then you would be mis-taken.ﬂ Nor did he say anything to the e˘ect of: ﬁIf you follow me you will be saved, and if you oppose me and follow your leaders then your reckoning is with Allah, and I have done what is required of me and you are free to choose.ﬂ Rather, he told them with full clarity: ﬁIt™s either me or the ˙ood.ﬂFurthermore, if anyone in the time of N˛h (‚alayhis-sal˚m) called to the principle of free choice for the people of N˛h, stating that N˛h is a caller to the true path but has no right to force people to follow his da™wah, such an individual would be considered a disbeliever in the da™wah of the Prophet N˛h even if he held it to be the truth in and of itself.PART 4 :10ARTICLEIGNORANCE AMONGST THE PEOPLETHE WIDESPREAD-----d -PART 5:11-------------12REPORTTHE FIGHT AGAINST THE PKK----------DEAD PKK SOLDIERS13-------THE ISTISHHADI ABU HAFS AT-TUNUSIPOUNDING THE PKK IN ZUR MAGHARGHANIMAH FROM ZUR MAGHAR14REPORT ON THE DESTRUCTION OF SHIRK INWIL˜YAT NW˜BLOWING UP THEﬁHUSAYNIYYAﬂ TEMPLE IN MOSULA PHOTO REPORT15BLOWING UP THEﬁHUSAYNIYYAﬂ TEMPLE IN MOSUL16REPORTBLOWING UP THEHUSAYNIYYATUL-QUBBAH TEMPLE IN MOSUL1718WISDOMHIJRAH ANDJIHADﬁHIJRAH WILL NOT CEASE AS LONG AS THERE IS JIHAD.ﬂ [MUSNAD AHMAD]ALLAH™S MESSENGER  (SALLALLAHU ‚ALAYHI WA SALLAM) SAID, ALLAH™S MESSENGER -grate and abandon your land and your --19ALLAH™S MESSENGER  (SALLALLAHU ‚ALAYHI WA SALLAM) SAID, PART 2:20FEATURETHE FLOOD OF THE MUB˜HALAHAll praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds.

Such was the case with Elton Simpson and Nadir Soo˛, two brave men who took it upon themselves to remind the enemies of Allah and His Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) that as long as they choose to wage war on Islam, they would have no peace and security, would not be able to walk their own streets without looking over their shoulders, and would not be able to make public appearances without being surrounding by a legion of bodyguards and security personnel. ˜e two lions of the Khil˚fah arrived at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas three weeks ago during a convention that featured a competition to draw the Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) in an attempt to mock and ridicule him. ˜e two muj˚hid˝n came armed and ready to wage war, ignited a gun battle with the policemen guarding the center, and attained a noble shah˚dah in pursuit of vengeance for the honor of our beloved Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam).˜eir determination to support the cause of Allah and punish those who insult the Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) should serve as inspiration to those residing in the lands of the crusaders who are still hesitant to perform their duty. ˜ose men who have read the countless ˚y˚t and ah˚d˝th on the virtues of jih˚d and have made sincere du™˚™ to Allah asking Him for shah˚dah but have yet to act, should consider that Allah will not grant them their du™˚™ until they take a step towards this noble duty.{And if they had intended to go forth, they would have prepared for it [some] preparation.

May Allah accept him.6ARTICLEOver the last months, a number of new Sahwah coalitions were formed that were either allied with or included the Jawl˚n˝ front. One of the older coalitions allied with the Jawl˚n˝ front against the Islamic State was the Sh˚miyyah Front with all its nationalist factions1. More recently, another coalition was formed in Idlib and named ﬁJaysh al-Fath.ﬂ Its member factions include the Jawl˚n˝ front and Faylaq ash-Sh˚m. Below, you will read an o˙cial declaration from Faylaq ash-Sh˚m, one of the major allies of the Jawl˚n˝ front against the Islamic State. After reading the declaration, it should be no secret that this faction and its likes work to execute the agenda of the taw˚gh˝t in the region.˜e apostates of Faylaq ash-Sh˚m had the following to say in their deviant declaration:ﬁAn Important Statement from Faylaq ash-Sh˚mﬂﬁIn the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the GraciousﬂﬁAll praise is for Allah, the Lord of the creation; and 1 To learn about this coalition, see ﬁ˜e Allies of al-Q˚™idah in Sh˚mﬂ in issue #8 of D˚biq.peace and blessings be upon His noble Messenger. {And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed Allah is Powerful, Exalted in Might} [Al-Hajj: 40].ﬂﬁDriven by the deeply sincere and brotherly relationship between the Syrian people and revolution and between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Œ both its government and people Œ and in response to what the Arabic and Islamic obligation dictates to us of standing with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which never delayed for even a day in supporting the aˆairs of the Arabs and Muslims, and in response to what needed to be done in this critical phase to achieve the Ummah™s interest against the divisive sectarian mission run by the Iranian government and what it represents of danger for the Ummah altogether–ﬂﬁ˜us, we in Faylaq ash-Sh˚m, announce our total backing, steady support, and standing with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with utter determination and strength under the leadership of the Servant of the Noble Haramayn, King Salm˚n Ibn ‚Abdil-Az˝z ˘l Saepel the forces of arrogance, ˜e Allies of al-Q˚™idah in Sh˚m: Part IIFaylaq ash-Sh˜m - Allies of the Jawl˜n˛ front and puppets of the Arab taw˜gh˛t7dabiqevil, and corruption that rushed madly to the blessed land of Yemen and dared encroaching upon the soil of the Noble Haramayn in the interest of a foreign, spiteful, divisive, Safaw˝ plan. We announce that this sectarian mission aims at dividing the Ummah, weakening its forces, taking its riches, and occupying the Muslims™ sanctuaries in Makkah al-Mukarramah and al-Mad˝nah al-Munawwarah. ˜is is a matter that we will never allow to happen, whatever the circumstances may be. ˜us we have prepared two thousand ˛ghters from the heroes of Faylaq ash-Sh˚m to be under the command of the Servant of the Noble Haramayn, King Salm˚n Ibn ‚Abdil-Az˝z ˘l Sa they defend the lands of the Noble Haramayn and defeat the enemies of the Ummah from amongst the tails and arms of Iran in the brotherly land of Yemen. We do this to support the truth and out of loyalty to the one who stood by and supported the struggle of the Syrian people. And we indeed stand up in defense of the Muslims™ holy sanctuaries through our humble contribution of two thousand ˛ghters from the best of the sons of Sh˚m. We appeal to the countries from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to rush to stand in the face of this Safaw˝ plan and to strive to stop all those who allowed themselves to transgress against our sanctities and holy sanctuaries. Indeed Iran™s insolence and that of its tails will not be deterred except with resolve2, and it will not be stopped except by the language of resolve, and this is what we are now doing with all strength and resolve, asking Allah (ta™˚l˚) for victory and steadfastness.ﬂﬁ{And Our word has already preceded for Our servants, the messengers, [˜at] indeed, they would be those given victory And [that] indeed, Our soldiers will be those who overcome} [As-S˚ˆ˚t: 171-173].ﬂﬁAnd our last call is that all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the creation.ﬂﬁFaylaq ash-Sh˚mﬂﬁ25 Rajab 1436 / 14 May 2015ﬂ˜is ends their statement of deviance.2 Editor™s Note: ˜is and all subsequent usage of the word is in reference to the ﬁStorm of Resolveﬂ announced by ˘l SIt is important to note that when the apostates (the Taw˚gh˝t and the R˚˛dah) ˛ght each other, it is not permissible for the Muslim to support one party of apostates against the other by ˛ghting under the leadership of one party or ˛ghting in its defense. Allah (ta™˚l˚) said, {˜ose who believe ˛ght in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelievo ˛ght against the allies of Shayt˚n} [An-Nis˚™: 76]. So it is not permissible for the Muslim to ˛ght against ˘l S Houthis nor is it permissible to ˛ght against the R˚˛d˝ Houthis under the leadership of ˘l S If he does ˛ght under the leadership of the  in defense of his kufr˝ regime, he apostatizes from Islam. ˜erefore, the Muslim should know that the obligation upon him when the apostates wage war against each other is to declare his bar˚™ah from both apostate parties and Œ if he is able Œ to perform jih˚d against both of them for Allah™s sake.As to the cause behind this deviant declaration being released, then it is the addiction of these nitially, the taw˚gh˝t trap them with supposedly ﬁinnocentﬂ and ﬁunconditionalﬂ aid before they slide down a slippery slope of concessions ending with blatant apostasy.And so, will the jih˚d claimants of the Jawl˚n˝ front wage ﬁjih˚dﬂ against their allies, the shameless slaves of ˘l Sr are there endless excuses prepared for each blatant statement of apostasy made by them? ˘l Se now openly occupied parts of Idlib, Halab, and Sh˚m in general through this ﬁlegion,ﬂ Zahr˚n ‚Alland their brothers from the ﬁIslamicﬂ Front.

So ‚Umar wrote back to him saying, ﬁAs to what follows, indeed whatever befalls a believing slave of hardship, Allah brings relief for him after it. Indeed a hardship will not overwhelm two eases1. Allah also says in His book, {O you who have believed, persevere and outlast (your enemy) in patience and perform rib˜t and fear Allah that you may be successful}ﬂ [Muwatta™ M˜lik].1 He refers to verses 5-6 of Sharh.˙e Virtues of Rib˜t For the Cause of Allah˜e Command of Allah  to Perform Rib˚t9dabiqAl-Hasan al-Basr˝ (rahimahull˚h) said in explanation of the ˚yah, ﬁHe ordered them to be patient upon their religion, and not to abandon it because of hardship, luxury, leisure, or adversity. He ordered them to outlast the kuˆ˚r in patience and to perform rib˚t against the mushrik˝nﬂ [Tafs˝r at-Tabar˝].Zayd Ibn Aslam (rahimahull˚h) said, ﬁBe patient upon jih˚d, outlast your enemy in patience, and perform rib˚t against your enemyﬂ [Tafs˝r at-Tabar˝].Qat˚dah (rahimahull˚h) said, ﬁ˜at means, be patient upon obedience to Allah, outlast in patience the people of deviance, perform rib˚t for the cause of Allah, {and fear Allah that you may be successful}ﬂ [Tafs˝r at-Tabar˝].Muhammad Ibn Ka™b al-Quradh˝ (rahimahull˚h) said, ﬁ{And perform rib˚t} against My enemy and your enemy until he abandons his religion for your religionﬂ [Tafs˝r Ibn al-Mundhir].˜e ˚yah is a command to perform the well-known rib˚t for Allah™s cause at the frontier posts, as it was interpreted by ‚Umar and Ibn ‚Abb˚s from the Sah˚bah (radiyall˚hu ‚anhum) and by al-Hasan al-Basr˝, Qat˚dah, Zayd Ibn Aslam, and Muhammad Ibn Ka™b from the T˚bi™˝n (rahimahumull˚h).As for the hadith reported by Muslim from A Hurayrah (radiyall˚hu ‚ (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁShall I not tell you that by which Allah erases your misdeeds and raises y™ despite hardships (cold weather and minor wounds), taking many steps towards the mas˚jid (for prayer), and waiting for the next prayer after the prayer ends. Indeed, this (waiting) is rib˚t,ﬂ then the hadith is similar to those ah˚d˝th describing jih˚d to be exerting oneself in obedience to Allah, hijrah to be abandoning what Allah dislikes, and Islam to be good words and feeding the poor2. It doesn™t limit the meaning of rib˚t to waiting for prayer nor does its wording indicate that it™s a commentary on the ˚yah. For this reason, at-Tabar˝ (rahimahull˚h) 2 See the Hikmah section of this issue.said after quoting the hadith from Aurayrah in his tafs˝r, ﬁHis statement {and perform rib˚t} means ‚perform rib˚t for Allah™s cause against your enemies and your religion™s enemies from amongst the people of shirk.™ I consider the linguistic root of rib˚t to be binding (irtib˚t) the horses in preparation for the enemy just as their enemy binds their horses in preparation for them. ˜e word was then used for every person stationed at the frontier posts defending those behind him Œ throughout the area between him and them Œ those whom the enemy desires to harm with evil, whether the enemy has horses he has bounded or is on foot without a riding animal for himself. ˜e reason we said that the meaning of {and perform rib˚t} is ‚perform rib˚t against your enemies and your religion™s enemies™ is because this is the well-known meaning of the meanings of rib˚t. Speech should be understood according to the people™s prevalent and well-known usages from amongst its meanings before resorting to the lesser-known meanings until a proof comes with something contrary requiring interpretation of the speech according to a lesser-known meaning. ˜is proof obligating submission would be a verse from the Qur™˚n, a narration from the Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam), or ijm˚™ (consensus) from the people of tafs˝r.ﬂIbn Qutaybah (rahimahull˚h) also said, ﬁ{And perform rib˚t} for Allah™s cause. And the linguistic basis of mur˚batah (rib˚t) is a bond: ˜at these people bind their horses and that those ones bind their horses at the frontier post. Each prepares for his counterpart. So the presence at the frontier posts was named rib˚tﬂ [Ghar˝b al-Qur™˚n].Many people also don™t realize the diˆerence between rib˚t (defending the frontier posts) and hir˚sah (guard duty). One might be on rib˚t but not on hir˚sah, like the mur˚bit at the frontier post sleeping, eating, exercising, talking, reading, or praying before or after his shift for hir˚sah. He might be a mur˚bit at the frontier post cooking and cleaning for the other mur˚bit˝n, waiting and prepared to defend the front against any attempt by the kuˆ˚r to advance, but never having a hir˚sah shift due to being needed in another service while 10ARTICLEon rib˚t, as determined by his leaders. He is a mur˚bit even if his turn for hir˚sah hasn™t come yet, won™t come for a very long time, or never comes at all, as long as he is sincerely committed to it if it comes. He is a mur˚bit even if the frontier post he defends is quiet, although the reward for defending a dangerous front is greater. And hir˚sah is a loftier level of jih˚d granted to him by Allah (ta™˚l˚) while he performs his rib˚t and it becomes obligatory on him if his leaders order him with it.  (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁTwo eyes will never be touched by Hell˛re: an eye that wept out of fear of Allah, and an eye that stayed up guarding for Allah™s causeﬂ [Hasan: Reported by at-Tirmidh˝ from Ibn ‚Abb˚s]. What an honor it is to exhaust one™s eyes while guarding the Muslims!Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁA day of rib˚t for Allah™s cause is better than the world and everything it contains. A place in Jannah as small as the whip of one of you is better than the world and everything it containsﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˚r˝ and Muslim from Sahl Ibn Sa™d].Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁRib˚t for a day and night is better than fasting and performing night-prayer for a month. And if he dies during rib˚t, he will go on receiving his reward for his deeds perpetually, he will receive his provision, and he will be saved from the tribulation (of the grave)ﬂ [Reported by Muslim from Salm˚n].Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁA day of rib˚t for Allah™s cause is better than a thousand days spent elsewhereﬂ [Hasan: Reported by at-Tirmidh˝ and an-Nas˚™˝ from ‚Uthm˚n Ibn ‚Aˆ˚n].Aurayrah (radiyall˚hu ‚anhu) said, ﬁA day of rib˚t for Allah™s cause is more beloved to me than to be (in prayer) on Laylatul-Qadr in one of the two mas˚jid: al-Masjid al-Har˚m and the masjid of alayhi wa sallam)ﬂ [Sunan Sa™˝d Ibn MWhat helps one understand the great reward in rib˚t is to contemplate that the worshippers of Allah Œ including the scholars Œ would not be able to perform their acts of worship if not for the mur˚bit˝n defending the frontier posts. If the mur˚bit˝n abandoned their positions, leaving them defenseless, all Muslim cities, towns, and villages would be under the threat of being attacked and ransacked. Accordingly, scholars have said that the mur˚bit achieves reward for all Muslims  worshipping Allah behind him, as his rib˚t enabled them to focus on their worship of Allah similar to how a Muslim who cares for a muj˚hid™s family during his absence achieves reward for the muj˚hid™alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁWhoever takes good care of the family of a ˛ghter ˛ghting for Allah™s cause during ˜e Virtue of a Single Day of Rib˚t11dabiqhis absence has fought in battleﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˚r˝ and Muslim from Zayd Ibn Kh˚lid].A man from the Ans˚r came to ‚Umar Ibn al-Khatt˚b (radiyall˚hu ‚anh). ‚Umar asked him, ﬁWhere have you been?ﬂ He replied, ﬁOn rib˚t.ﬂ He asked, ﬁHow many days of rib˚t did you perform?ﬂ He answered, ﬁ˜irty days.ﬂ He told him, ﬁWhy did you not complete it by performing forty?ﬂ [Musannaf ‚Abdir-Razz˚q].A son of Ibn ‚Umar (radiyall˚hu ‚anhuma) performed rib˚t for thirty nights and then returned. So Ibn ‚Umar told him, ﬁI insist that you go back and perform rib˚t for ten more nights until you complete the forty!ﬂ [Musannaf Ibn Ab˝ Shaybah].AHurayrah (radiyall˚hu ‚anhu) said, ﬁComplete rib˚t is forty daysﬂ [Musannaf Ibn Ab˝ Shaybah].Because of these ˚th˚r and others, when Im˚m Ahmad was asked, ﬁIs there a (preferred) length of time for rib˚t?ﬂ He answered, ﬁForty days.ﬂ Ish˚q Ibn R˚hawayh commented, ﬁIt is as he saidﬂ [Mas˚™il al-Im˚m Ahmad wa Ish˚q Ibn R˚hawayh]. ˜ese ˚th˚r indicate that when one performs rib˚t it is best (not obligatory) that he does so for at least forty days or even more before returning for rest. ˜is is rib˚t upon the methodology of the Salaf.Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁ˜e deeds of every dead person come to a halt with his death except the one who is a mur˚bit for Allah™s cause. His deeds will be made to go on increasing for him until the Day of Resurrection. And he will be secured from the trial of the graveﬂ [Sah˝h: Reported by Airmidh˝ from Fad˚lah Ibn ‚Ubayd].˜e prophetic had˝th reported by Muslim from Salm˚n al-F˚ris˝ (radiyall˚hu ‚anh) was mentioned earlier: ﬁIf he (the mur˚bit) dies during rib˚t, he will go on receiving his reward for his deeds perpetually, he will receive his provision, and he will be saved from the tribulation (of the grave).ﬂ˜is death is of the noblest deaths and this reward is guaranteed for the mur˚bit who passes away during rib˚t even if his death is due to disease, elderliness, or some accident. How much more noble is his death when it is shah˚dah caused by the airstrikes of the crusaders and their apostate allies?˜e reward of one™s deed growing after death was mentioned in another had˝th. ﬁIf the son of ˘dam dies, his deeds stop except for three: an ongoing charity, knowledge being bene˛tted from, and a righteous son who supplicates for himﬂ [Reported by Muslim from Aurayrah]. ˜e reward for this charity, knowledge, or son continues as long as the charity exists, the knowledge is bene˛tted from, and the son supplicates for his father, as implied by this had˝th and as made explicit by others, whereas the reward for dying while on rib˚t continues to grow independent of any other condition, and this is only for the mur˚bit! ˜is reward is not mentioned for the battleground shah˝d but for the mur˚bit who might have died during his rib˚t due to old age and while sleeping for rest! So how noble of a death is this? And how much of an encouragement is this for one to supplicate for the noblest death Œ shah˚dah Œ while on rib˚t!Ibn ‚Abb˚s (radiyall˚hu ‚anhum˚) said that Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁ˜e ˛rst of this aˆair is prophethood and mercy. ˜en will come khil˚fah and mercy. ˜en will come kingship and mercy. ˜en they will bite each other over the Duny˚ like the donkeys do. ˜erefore, adhere to jih˚d. And indeed the best jih˚d of yours (then) is rib˚t. And indeed the best rib˚t of yours (then) is in ‚Asqal˚nﬂ [Reported by at-Tabar˚n˝ with a hasan isn˚d]. ‚Asqal˚n is a city in Palestine.Similar narrations were reported with diˆerences in wording (as well as additions and omissions) ˜e Salaf and Forty Days of Rib˚t˜e Virtue of Dying While on Rib˚tRib˚t and the Best Jih˚d12ARTICLEboth as words of the Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) and as words of some of the Sah˚bah (radiyall˚hu ‚anhum) [See: Ibn Ab˝ Shaybah, Ibn Hibb˚n, and al-H˚kim]. And Allah knows best. ˜e other narrations indicate that rib˚t becomes the best jih˚d after the era of the merciful Muslim kings from amongst the khulaf˚™, during the reign of the tyrannical Muslim kings. ˜eir reign was prior to the apostate taw˚gh˝t™s era, whose era is ended Œ insh˚™all˚h Œ with the revival of the Khil˚fah. And Allah knows best.Im˚m Ahmad (rahimahull˚h) said, ﬁIn my opinion, nothing is equal in reward to jih˚d and rib˚t. Rib˚t defends the Muslims and their families. It is strength for the people of the frontier posts and the people of battle. ˜erefore, rib˚t is the root and branch of jih˚d. Jih˚d is better than it because of its hardship and fatigue. – ˜e best rib˚t is the ˛ercest.ﬂ [Al-Mughn˝].Accordingly, if there were no need for more mur˚bit˝n (which may only be determined by the Im˚m), one did not prefer battle over rib˚t because of his impatience or self-assumption, and one performed rib˚t in general and returned to it after battle, then ˛ghting in battle would be better because of what it contains of dangers and hardships. Otherwise, one should know that ˛ghting in battle to avoid rib˚t is improper for the true muj˚hid to merely consider. It can reach the level of major sin if it entails turning away from necessary rib˚t or disobeying the orders of leaders. How much more so is such thought dangerous when all the frontier posts are the priority for the crusaders and apostates in their attempts and plans to advance on the lands of the Khil˚fah?Sufy˚n Ibn ‚Uyaynah (rahimahull˚h) said, ﬁWhen you see the people diˆer, I advise you to refer to the muj˚hid˝n and the people of the frontier posts, for Allah says, {And those who have waged jih˚d for Us Œ We will surely guide them to Our ways} Allah™s Guidance and Blessing For the Mur˚bit˛n13dabiq[Al-‚Tafs˝r Ibn Ab˝ H˚tim; Tafs˝r al-Qurtub˝].Shaykhul-Isl˚m Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnul-Qayyim (rahimahumall˚h) also credit this statement of wisdom to al-Awz˚™˝, Ibnul-Mub˚rak, and Im˚m Ahmad, and others (rahimahumull˚h) [M™ al-Fat˚w˚; Mad˚rij as-S˚lik˝n].After quoting Ibnul-Mub˚rak and Im˚m Ahmad on this, Shaykul-Isl˚m Ibn Taymiyyah said, ﬁIn general, living on the frontiers, performing rib˚t, and concerning oneself with rib˚t is a great matter. ˜e frontier posts were inhabited with the best Muslims in knowledge and deeds. ˜ey were the best lands in establishing the rites of Islam, the rm˚n, and the commanding of the good and forbidding of the evil. Everyone who wanted to dedicate himself to the worship of Allah, devote himself to Him, and achieve the best zuhd, worship, and awareness, then the scholars would direct him towards the frontier postsﬂ [J˚mi™ al-Mas˚™il].Al-Mundhir˝ (rahimahull˚h) titled a chapter in his book ﬁAt-Targh˝b wat-Tarh˝bﬂ with ﬁEncouraging the Fighter and Mur˚bit to Increase ˜eir Righteous Deeds including Fasting, Prayer, Dhikr, and so Forthﬂ He then mentioned the had˝th reported by al-Bukh˚r˝ and Muslim from Aa™˝d al-Khudr˝ (radiyall˚hu ‚anh) in which the Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁWhoever fasts a day while f˝sab˝lill˚h (performing jih˚d), then Allah will distance his face seventy years from Hell˛re.ﬂ He then mentioned numerous other ah˚d˝th indicating that worship performed while on jih˚d is multiplied in rewards. He then said, ﬁWhat is apparent is that the mur˚bit is also f˝sab˝lill˚h. ˜erefore his righteous deeds are also multiplied in blessing just as the muj˚hid™s deeds are multiplied.ﬂ ˜e opportunity for good deeds while on rib˚t is greater than that during battle, as the mur˚bit can pray, fast, read, teach, etc., with ease, whereas the ˛ghter is often busied by the ˛erceness of battle, which in some cases can force him to even break the mandatory fast and delay the obligatory prayer.˜e above-mentioned ˚yah (Al-‚ shows that seeking knowledge while on rib˚t will be blessed by Allah™s guidance for the slave. A mur˚bit can memorize the Qur™˚n, study its tafs˝r, memorize had˝th, and study its meaning. He can study tawh˝d, ˝m˚n, adab, zuhd, ˛qh, s˝rah– And when he supplicates Allah to be enabled to practice what he has learned, he will ˛nd his du™˚™ answered and the anticipated guidance granted. His rib˚t Œ insh˚™all˚h Œ will keep the knowledge ˛rm in his heart and its eˆect ongoing on his tongue and limbs. Likewise, various ah˚d˝th show that his rib˚t will also multiply the blessings in other acts of worship he performs while at the frontier posts.Since the revival of jih˚d more than thirty years ago, muj˚hid leaders have stated that jih˚d Œ on the personal level Œ consists of strides on a roadmap towards shah˚dah. One ˛rst performs hijrah to the lands of jih˚d (now, d˚rul-Isl˚m), then gives bay™ah, pledging what it entails of obedience (sam™ and t˚™ah) to the am˝r (now, the Khal˝fah) and commitment to the jam˚™ah (now, the Khil˚fah), then trains (i™d˚d) for the purpose of jih˚d, then patiently spends months of r˝bat, serves countless hours of guard duty (hir˚sah), then ˛ghts (qit˚l) in battles and kills (qatl) whom he can from amongst the k˚˛r enemy, and ˛nally achieves shah˚dah. ˜is map is based on texts from the Qur™˚n and Sunnah3 linking these deeds to each other, the experience gained by living jih˚d on a day to day basis, and the observation of the shuhad˚™ and their caravans. Of course, there are always exceptions, such as the muh˚jir who achieves shah˚dah during his training camp or the mur˚bit who achieves it on his ˛rst day of rib˚t. But this is the roadmap every muj˚hid should grasp so as to maximize the fruits of his jih˚d. Otherwise, how can one expect to be patient on the fearsome battle˛eld while not enduring the hardships of rib˚t?May Allah (ta™˚l˚) grant every Muslim the blessing of rib˚t at the Khil˚fah frontier posts and the patience needed to keep him ˛rm until he meets Him.3 See, for example, pages 30-31 of issue #1 and pages 18-19 of issue #2.Rib˚t and the Path to Shah˚dah14ARTICLE{Indeed, Our word to a thing when We intend it is but that We say to it, ﬁBe,ﬂ and it is} [An-Nahl: 40]. {Originator of the heavens and the earth.

Only All˚h (ta™˚l˚) knows the minutest details of everything, controls all events, and possesses every atomic particle. Even the pagans of the J˚hiliyyah in the Arabian Peninsula did not doubt that Allah alone possessed absolute power, knowledge, and ownership, but they committed shirk in many ways including attributing partial knowledge of the unseen to soothsayers, assigning shares of their crops and livestock to idols, and claiming their idols held some inˇuence to intercede for them. As for claiming their idols, soothsayers, and kings had absolute or near-absolute power, knowledge, and ownership, then this was too much for even the corrupted ˛trah of the j˚hiliyy˝n to tolerate.Sadly, this shirk˝ attitude (both minor and major) entered the hearts and minds of many supposedly ﬁIslamicﬂ leaders, scholars, and callers Œ in imitation of the Arab nationalists before them Œ as they began to describe the enemies of Islam with attributes bordering r™s lordship). To them, the kuˆ˚r had the near-absolute knowledge, power, and ownership to plot and execute any grand conspiracy of their desire. It is almost as if they attribute to them the ability to create with the word ﬁbeﬂ! ˜eir evil became most apparent in issues related to jih˚d. If one desired to perform jih˚d, these leaders would warn that jih˚d now was a conspiracy to kill oˆ the sincere Muslim youth and thereby leave the Muslims™ lands to the secularists. If one wanted to join a jih˚d jam˚™ah, they would warn that it was the creation of the kuˆ˚r so as to aid in achieving k˚˛r interests. If jih˚d operations Œ like those of September 11th Œ were carried out against the kuˆ˚r, they would claim these operations were conspiracies by the kuˆ˚r to justify their aggression against Muslims. If a muj˚hid leader achieved shah˚dah, they would say that the kuˆ˚r used him up and needed The blessed raid on the Twin Towersin New York16ARTICLEto dispose of him just in case he decided to come out and expose the ﬁconspiracyﬂ of which he was supposedly a part. If the muj˚hid˝n liberated territory occupied by the kuˆ˚r, they would say that the kuˆ˚r allowed them to do so because k˚˛r interests necessitated a prolonged war. If the muj˚hid˝n announced an Islamic state, they would say that the kuˆ˚r facilitated such so as to justify their continued interference in Muslim aˆairs. And so, according to these theorists, almost all the events of the world were somehow linked back to the kuˆ˚r, their intelligence agencies, research, technology, and coconspirators!Conspiracy theories have thereby become an excuse to abandon jih˚d, to have great awe for the kuˆ˚r, to forsake the obligation of bay™ah, and to pursue the Duny˚, all in the name of political ﬁawareness.ﬂOne of the worst aspects of these theories is that they require no evidence, just foolish ﬁdeductions.ﬂ And worse yet, many of these conspiracy claimants are themselves involved in real k˚˛r conspiracies! You see the Iraqi Sahwah ˛ghting alongside the Iraqi army Œ openly backed by Iran Œ while claiming that the muj˚hid˝n are agents of Iran! You see Sahwah factions openly handing over territory to the Nusayr˝ regime, while claiming the muj˚hid˝n cooperate with the Nusayr˝ regime! You see the diˆerent Sawhah factions openly and publically meeting with Qatar, Turkey, ˘l Sand the Americans and discussing their plans for cooperation against the Islamic State, while claiming that the muh˚jir˝n and ans˚r are allies and agents of foreign states! You see the Syrian National Coalition considering meetings in Geneva with the Nusayr˝ regime, while claiming that the Islamic State strives to serve regime interests!No evidence is required to deduce a conspiracy, just desire and foolishness. As for when the cooperation with the kuˆ˚r against Muslims is clearly public, it suddenly becomes ﬁmaslahahﬂ (the greater ﬁgoodﬂ). It is a ﬁmaslahahﬂ to cooperate with the Americans against the Islamic State, not a conspiracy of kufr and treachery! It is a ﬁmaslahahﬂ to cooperate with those factions backed by the taw˚gh˝t and crusaders against the Islamic State, not deviance nor apostasy! It is a ﬁmaslahahﬂ to advance under the cover of crusader and apostate planes against the Islamic State, not a gate to the deepest levels of Hell˛re! It is a ﬁmaslahahﬂ to use the words ﬁcivil law,ﬂ ﬁcivil state,ﬂ and ﬁself-determination,ﬂ not submission to the demands of one™s crusader and apostate backers!˜e extreme belief in conspiracy theories varies between minor and major shirk depending on the degree of power, knowledge, and ownership attributed by its believer to the kuˆ˚r.If one were to reinterpret the history of the Muslims in accordance to the conspiracy theories of these theorists, he would come out with grave deviance. One only has to ask these theorists, were the Muslims able to establish a state and expand it only with consent from the Roman and Persian empires? Were the Muslims agents of the Romans or Persians during their wars against these two rival empires? Were the Persians faking their war against the Romans while secretly being their allies? Were the Muslims faking their battles against one of the two rival empires? Were the false prophets and The apostate former head of the Syrian National Council17dabiqanti-zak˚h leaders secretly non-Arabs belonging to a foreign race? ˜e answer to all these questions is undoubtedly no. Has the world changed so much for these grand conspiracies to develop and overpower the world? ˜e answer is no. {But you will never ˛nd in the sunnah of Allah any change, and you will never ˛nd in the sunnah of Allah any alteration} [F˚tir: 43].And to these conspiracy theorists one asks, how are the following verses to be understood in light of these grand conspiracy theories?{˜ey will not ˛ght you all except within forti˛ed cities or from behind walls. ˜eir violence among themselves is severe. You think they are together, but their hearts are diverse. ˜at is because they are a people who do not reason} [Al-Hashr: 14]. ˜is verse explains that the kuˆ˚r may appear united whereas their hearts are actually full of animosity and enmity for each other. And this hatred sometimes manifests itself in their deeds. How can extremely grand conspiracies be executed if its members are so divided?{˜e Jews say, ﬁ˜e Christians have nothing true to stand on,ﬂ and the Christians say, ﬁ˜e Jews have nothing to stand on,ﬂ although they both recite the Scripture. ˜us, those who do not know [i.e. the mushrik˝n] speak the same as their words–} [Al-Baqarah: 113]. ˜is verse explains that the animosity and enmity between the followers of the diˆerent kufr˝ religions is manifest in their words.{Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the People of the Scripture, ﬁIf you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone Œ ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you.ﬂ But Allah testi˛es that they are liars. If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. And if they should aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then they will not be aided} [Al-Hashr: 11-12]. ˜is verse explains that the hypocritical allies of the kuˆ˚r are too unreliable to execute the orders of the kuˆ˚r. So how are their grand conspiracies supposedly kept intact for decades and centuries?{And from those who say, ﬁWe are Christiansﬂ We took their covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded. So We caused among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. And Allah is going to inform them about what they used to do} [Al-M˚™idah: 14]. ˜is verse explains the great partisan hatred the various Christian parties have for each other.{And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them [the Jews] in transgression and disbelief. And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the ˛re of war, Allah extinguished it} [Al-M˚™idah: 64]. ˜is explains the great partisan hatred the various Jewish parties have for each other.{And those who were given the Scripture did not diˆer except after knowledge had come to them Œ out of animosity between themselves} [˘l ‚Imr˚n: 19]. {And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them Œ out of animosity between themselves} [Ash-S verses explain the division and diˆering of the Jews and Christians and the animosity present between the two religions and their sects.{[Ms˚, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection–ﬂ} [˘l ‚Imr˚n: 55]. Ibn Zayd (rahimahull˚h) said in explanation of this verse, ﬁ˜ere is not a land with a person from the Christians inhabiting it, whether in the East or West, except that he is above the Jews. ˜e Jews are humiliated in all the landsﬂ [Tafs˝r at-Tabar˝]. And this is despite the kufr of the Christians. But because the k˚˛r Christians did not curse Prophet s˚ (‚alayhis-sal˚m) nor accuse his virtuous mother of sin, they were made to humiliate the Jews who s˚ and slandered Maryam.{˜ey [the Jews] have been put under humiliation wherever they are overtaken, except for a covenant 18ARTICLEfrom Allah and a rope from the Muslims. And they have drawn upon themselves anger from Allah and have been put under destitution} [˘l ‚Imr˚n: 112]. Al-Hasan (rahimahull˚h) said in explanation of this verse, ﬁ˜is Ummah overtook the Jews while the Mom the Jewsﬂ [Tafs˝r at-Tabar˝]. ˜is verse explains that the accursed Jews are always in humiliation and overpowered. ˜e Jewish state itself was established for the Jews primarily by the British crusaders. And it was through Jewish-Crusader relationships and the self-degradation of the Arab apostates that the Jews gained mastery over the Arab taw˚gh˝t.˜erefore, after this discussion, the following should be understood when examining history and current events.1) ˜e knowledge, power, and ownership of the kuˆ˚r are weak and limited. ˜ey do not see all, hear all, know all, control all, and own all, as some individuals try to portray them. Whoever believes that has fallen into shirk.2) ˜e only ancient conspiracy mentioned in the Qur™˚n is that of the accursed Ibl˝s. Allah (ta™˚l˚) said about his plot, {Indeed, the plot of Shayt˚n has ever been weak} [An-Nis˚™: 76]. Accordingly, the plots of Shayt˚n™s allies are even weaker. Rather, they are the object of Allah™s plot against them.3) ˜e kuˆ˚r are divided, hold animosity and enmity towards each other, carry out violence against each other, humiliate and degrade each other, yet they unite against the Muslims, their common enemy. {O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. ˜ey are [in fact] allies of one another} [Al-M˚™idah: 51]. {And those who disbelieved are allies of one another} [Al-Anf˚l: 73]. But the kuˆ˚r™s unity is fragile and super˛cial. ˜ey often divide after unity and betray each other.4) ˜e kuˆ˚r undoubtedly do plot out conspiracies, but these plots are weak due to the fragile relationships the kuˆ˚r have with each other, the unreliability and cowardice of their hypocritical allies and agents, the kuˆ˚r™s fear of the Muslims more than their own fear of Allah, and the kuˆ˚r™s fear of death and love of the Duny˚.5) ˜eir real conspiracies always have material evidence and are not based on unsupported deductions Œ {guessing at the unseen} [Al-Kahf: 22]. {And they have thereof no knowledge. ˜ey follow not except assumption, and indeed, assumption avails not against the truth at all} [An-Najm: 28]. A common enemy and mutual interests does not necessitate that the muj˚hid˝n are agents of one of the two k˚˛r camps (especially when the muj˚hid˝n ˛ght both camps and are fought by both camps). ˜e muj˚hid˝n against the communist Russians were not agents of the crusader Americans, just as the Muslims™ war against the Persian Empire did not necessitate that the Muslims were agents of the Romans! Also, when one reˇects on modern history, the diˆerent apostates waging nationalist wars always had open relationships with their k˚˛r allies. ˜e real conspiracies were not secrets hidden from mankind. ˜e Iraqi Sahwah openly met with Bush, the Iraqi regime, and R˚˛d˝ leaders. ˜e ﬁIslamicﬂ Sahwah factions of Iraq would openly ˛ght alongside the tribal Sahwah against the Islamic State and would have public political representation under the shade of regional taw˚gh˝t. ˜e Syrian Sahwah openly meets in Qatar, Turkey, and ﬁSaudiﬂ Arabia. ˜e Americans openly discuss their backing of the Syrian Sahwah and the support granted to its ﬁIslamicﬂ factions by American allies Œ Qatar, Turkey, and ˘l S And long ago, the agents of the ﬁArab Revoltﬂ would openly meet in Europe, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Sh˚m, and Iraq with diˆerent crusader o˙cials from amongst the British. 6) Grand conspiracies consist of so many factors only controllable by Allah (ta™˚l˚). An example of such a grand conspiracy theory is that of September 11th being carried out by the Americans themselves. How many members of the crusader government would have to be under permanent watch to prevent news of the operation getting out before its execution? How many involved mouths would have to be silenced all over the world to keep such a conspiracy from not being exposed after 19dabiqthe fact? How many other matters would have to be guaranteed to preserve the conspiracy? Such an exaggerated outlook to the event only comes at the price of tawh˝d. Does America have control over so many factors? ˜e attack was against America itself, and according to the conspiracy theorists, it was executed by the Americans! How many American o˙cials would have felt themselves to be committing ﬁtreasonﬂ by knowing of the ﬁconspiracyﬂ and remaining silent? ˜e reality can only be the obvious one Œ the de˛nite truth Œ and that is that the muj˚hid˝n under the leadership of Shaykh Us˚mah (rahimahull˚h) carried out the blessed attack and thereby humiliated America in a manner it never experienced before.7) ˜e purpose of conspiracy theories is to exaggerate the power of the kuˆ˚r and thereby the Muslims become paralyzed by analysis of current events and eventually fear the kuˆ˚r more than they fear Allah (ta™˚l˚). It is a method to ruin a Muslim™s tawakkul (reliance) upon his Lord. Over time, he will ˛nd himself being encompassed by the following verses: {Give tidings to the hypocrites that there is for them a painful punishment Œ those who take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do they seek with them might? But indeed, might belongs to Allah entirely} [An-Nis˚™: 138-139].In light of this, one should realize the diˆerence between the various rival parties of the kuˆ˚r forming real alliances Œ like the Crusader-Safaw˝-Nusayr˝ coalition Œ to wage war against the Islamic State and thereby achieve their mutual k˚˛r interests, and between believing that the Christians, R˚˛dah, Jews, and apostates are all covert members of the same secret society, underground political party, or grandiose conspiracy theory, all of them adoring each other and faking their hostilities.May Allah expose the real conspiracies of the kuˆ˚r and erase the shirk˝ conspiracy theories from the hearts.The aftermath of the blessed raid on the Twin Towers 20HISTORYAs a number of military factions in the lands of the so-called ﬁArab Springﬂ raise banners of a j˚hil˝ origin, and because a number of jih˚d claimants have permitted and justi˛ed the raising of these banners in their supposed territories, even supporting the carriers of these banners from amongst the apostate Sahwah1 against the Islamic State, it becomes important to enlighten the Muslim Ummah about the history behind these banners.˜e historical origin of the ﬁArab Springﬂ banners Œ rather most of the ˇags raised by the various apostate Arab regimes Œ is a ˇag designed by the British crusader Mark Sykes. Yes, Mark Sykes of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which divided the Muslims™ lands into nationalist states, the same crusader who also promoted the infamous Balfour Declaration behind the establishment of the Jewish state.1 See pages 7-11 of issue #8 to read about the nationalist allies of the new al-Q˚™idah in Sh˚m and see samples of their various banners.21dabiqBlack was chosen to represent the ‚Abb˚s˝ state, white to represent the Umaw˝ state, green to represent the ‚Ubayd˝ (ﬁF˚tim˝ﬂ) state, and red to represent the late ﬁShar˝fﬂ2 leadership of Hij˚z. In this symbolism, he mixed between Islamic khulaf˚™, apostate Ism˚™˝liyyah, and apostate agents. He needed to give his Arab followers something symbolic, historical, material, and uniquely ﬁArabianﬂ for them to rally around. ˜is j˚hil˝ banner became the ˇag of the so-called ﬁArab Revoltﬂ he engineered. ˜e ˇag was initially manufactured in Egypt by the British Military to be raised by their allies.Sykes™s allies from amongst the Arab nationalists used a line of poetry written by Saf˝ ad-D˝n al-Hill˝ Œ who died in 750AH Œ to endorse these j˚hil˝ symbols. Al-Hill˝ said, ﬁOur deeds are white, our battles are black, our ˛elds are green, and our swords are red.ﬂ No doubt, his line of poetry was written hundreds of years before the ﬁArab Revolt.ﬂSykes, together with his peers and leaders, devised a plan to further divide the broken Muslims™ lands into nationalist states. ˜e Muslims™ lands had been polluted by pagan domes (for grave worship) and plagued by manmade laws at the hands of Ottoman rulers, especially in the last two centuries before the eventual collapse of Ottoman reign. ˜is fragile condition coupled with the policy of turki˛cation Œ which promoted Turkish nationalism and degraded the Arabic language Œ aided Sykes and his allies in promoting the ﬁArab Revolt.ﬂ˜e British began negotiating with al-Husayn Ibn ‚Al˝3  (the ﬁShar˝fﬂ of Hij˚z Œ died 1350AH/1931CE) to rebel and declare an independent Arab nationalist state. Al-Husyan Ibn ‚Al˝ revolted against his former Ottoman masters and declared himself, with the permission of the British, ﬁSultan of the Arab Landsﬂ and ﬁCaliphﬂ over a nationalist ﬁcaliphateﬂ erected by 2 ˜e word literarily means ﬁthe noble.ﬂ ˜e leaders of Hij˚z (Makkah, al-Mad˝nah, and surrounding regions) since 597AH/1200CE up until 1344AH/1925CE all descended from Qat˚dah Ibn Idr˝s al-Hasan˝ (died 618AH) and were referred to by the title ﬁshar˝fﬂ because of their Hasan˝ lineage. Because of the later generations™ apostasy through shirk and wal˚™ to the apostates and the crusaders, they are not deserving of this praiseworthy title.3 Because the names are similar, it should be noted that everywhere the name al-Husayn Ibn ‚Al˝ is used here, then it is referring to this crusader agent and not to the noble son of ‚Al˝ Ibn Ab˝ T˚lib (radiyall˚hu ‚anh).the crusaders! He did not wage jih˚d for Allah™s cause to rid the Muslims™ lands of manmade laws and pagan domes and thereby establish a shar™˝ khil˚fah. Rather he fought merely to unify the ﬁArabﬂ lands alone under a nationalist ﬁcaliphateﬂ that he would rule over, but under the direction of his new crusader masters.During the various battles he and his sons led in the ﬁArab Revolt,ﬂ their soldiers were accompanied and supported by British crusaders including Colonel Cyril Wilson, Colonel Pierce C.

And how much more serious is it when an ﬁIslamicﬂ faction seeks the aid of the kuˆ˚r against the muh˚jir˝n and ans˚r of the Islamic State!5) ˜e crusaders eventually abandon or betray their apostate allies for other agents drowning deeper into apostasy. ˜ey prioritize their enemies. ˜ey might temporarily support bearded apostates coming from ﬁmore Islamicﬂ parties or factions only to later stab them in the back or allow their more loyal agents and allies to do so.6) ˜e crusaders might use people with symbolism and ﬁhistoryﬂ to achieve their interests.

So Hudhayfah took care of killing him. ˜en he went to the director of ﬁCounter-Terrorism,ﬂ the enemy of Allah, Mu™ayyad as-S˚lih. He executed him and retaliated for the Muslims. Likewise, the brother A military leader of Baghdad, and the rest of his brothers clashed with the apostates and they killed everyone in the prison in which the muj˚hid˝n were tortured and had experienced that which only Allah knows of.˜ey rode the apostates™ car from the prison building and arrived at the Interior Ministry™s gateway. ˜ey then clashed with the apostates. ˜e crusaders stepped in, striking them with Apache helicopters. However, the brothers persisted with their combat until they were all killed while facing the enemy not retreating. ˜ey were ten from the best of knights, led by our knight, the W˚l˝ Hudhayfah al-Batt˚w˝. He (rahimahull˚h) was eager to achieve shah˚dah, so he got what he was yearning for, not dying until he made the apostates cry, debilitated them with wounds, and made them taste death and sadness that kindled in them the pain of defeat and failure. He (rahimahull˚h) was already married for some time before his killing, and at the time of his arrest, he was bestowed with a child. He (rahimahull˚h) was killed and never met his son. ˜e worldly life, its pleasures, and adornments did not succeed in tempting him even for a single day. Every Muslim should raise his head out of pride for these men, with glory and honor, in the face of the people of falsehood. We ask Allah (ta™˚l˚) not to deprive us of His reward, nor to make us succumb to tribulations, and to generously bestow upon him as well as his brothers the reward and high rank in Jannah.The R˜˝d˛ t˜gh˚t Nouri al-Maliki44FROM OUR SISTERSIn the Name of Allah, the Strong, the Firm, He who strengthens the Muslims with His aid, and humiliates the mushrik˝n with His compulsion. And may peace and blessings be upon the exemplary Prophet and Messenger, and upon those who followed him and treaded his footsteps, and upon his family, companions, and those who supported him. As to what follows:Allah (ta™˚l˚) said, {And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. ˜at is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice]} [An-Nis˚™: 3].He also said, {And marry oˆ the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. If they should be poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty, and Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing} [An-NHe also said, describing His believing slaves, {And they who guard their private parts, except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed} [Al-Mu™ 5-6].He (subh˚nah) said, inciting His believing servants to marry female slaves (if they cannot aˆord to marry freewomen) and preferring them to a free mushrikah of noble lineage, {And a believing slave-girl is better than a mushrikah, even though she might please you} [Al-Baqarah: 221].˜e right hand™s possession (mulk al-yam˝n) are the female captives who were separated from their husbands by enslavement. ˜ey became lawful for the one who ends up possessing them even without pronouncement of divorce by their harb˝ husbands.Sa™˝d Ibn Jubayr reported that Ibn ‚Abb˚s (radiyall˚hu ‚anhum˚) said, ﬁApproaching any married woman is fornication, except for a woman who has been enslavedﬂ [Al-H˚kim narrated it and said, ﬁIt is an authentic had˝th according to the criteria of al-Bukh˚r˝ and Muslimﬂ].45dabiqSaby (taking slaves through war) is a great prophetic Sunnah containing many divine wisdoms and religious bene˛ts, regardless of whether or not the people are aware of this. ˜e S˝rah is a witness to our Prophet™s (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) raiding of the kuˆ˚r. He would kill their men and enslave their children and women. ˜e raids of the beloved Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) convey this to us. Ask the tribes of Ban˝ al-Mustaliq, Ban˝ Quraydhah, and Haw˚zin about this.Ibn ‚Awn said, ﬁI wrote to N˚˛™, so he wrote back to me saying, ‚˜e Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) raided Ban˝ al-Mustaliq while they were not expecting it and while their cattle were out drinking water. So he killed their ˛ghters, enslaved their children, and gained Juwayriyah. Ibn ‚Umar told me this. And he was part of that army™ﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˚r˝ and Muslim].After the Battle of the Trench, Ban˝ Quraydhah yielded to the judgment of Sa™d Ibn Mu™˚dh (radiyall˚hu ‚anh). So Sa™d said, ﬁI rule that their ˛ghters be killed and their families be enslaved.ﬂ So Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁYou have indeed judged in their aˆair by the ruling of Allahﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˚r˝ and Muslim].˜e number of Jews killed in the battles of Khaybar reached 93 men [Magh˚z˝ al-W˚qid˝]. ˜eir women and children were enslaved, and Sa˛yyah Bint Huyayy Ibn Akhtab Œ the Mother of the Believers (radiyall˚hu ‚anh˚) Œ fell into captivity. Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) set her free and married her [Reported by al-Bukh˚r˝ and Muslim].And during the expedition of Hunayn, Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) enslaved from Haw˚zin until the amount of slaves reached six thousand [At-Tabaq˚t al-Kubr˚ Œ Ibn Sa™d].˜e scholars of S˝rah mentioned that the Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) took four slave-girls as concubines, two of them being M˚riyah al-Qibtiyyah and Rayh˚nah an-Nadriyyah [Z˚d al-Ma™˚d].˜e Sah˚bah and their followers in goodness treaded upon the path of the Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) after him. ˜erefore, we almost cannot ˛nd a companion who didn™t practice saby. ‚Al˝ Ibn Ab˝ T˚lib (radiyall˚hu ‚anh) had nineteen slave-girls. Ibn ‚Uyaynah reported that ‚Amr Ibn D˝n˚r said, ﬁ™Al˝ Ibn Ab˝ T˚lib wrote in his will, ‚As to what follows: If something happens to me during this battle, then my slave-girls whom I copulate with are nineteen in number. Some of them bore me children, some of them are pregnant, and some of them are childless™ﬂ [Musannaf ‚Abdir-Razz˚q].Aa™˝d al-Khudr˝ (radiyall˚hu ‚anh) said, ﬁI had a slave-girl with whom I used to practice withdrawal. She bore me the most beloved of people to meﬂ [Musannaf ‚Abdir-Razz˚q].After all this and after the sun of the Khil˚fah radiated once again, and the winds of victory and consolidation blew, and the Islamic State, by the grace of its Lord alone, brought out the Islamic punishments and rulings of the Shar˝™ah from the darkness of books and papers, and we truly lived them after they were buried for centuries– After all this, the ramblers dare to extend their tongues with false rumors and accusations so as to dis˛gure the great shar™˝ ruling and pure prophetic Sunnah titled ﬁsabyﬂ? After all this, saby becomes fornication and tasarr˝ (taking a slave-girl as a concubine) becomes rape? If only we™d heard these falsehoods from the kuˆ˚r who are ignorant of our religion. Instead we hear it from those associated with our Ummah, those whose names are Muhammad, Ibr˚h˝m, and ‚Al˝! So I say in astonishment: Are our people awake or asleep? But what really alarmed me was that some of the Islamic State supporters (may Allah forgive them) rushed to defend the Islamic State Œ may its honor persist and may Allah expand its territory Œ after the k˚˛r media touched upon the State™s capture of the Yaz˝d˝ women. So the supporters started denying the matter as if the soldiers of the Khil˚fah had committed a mistake or evil.˜us, after the matter transcended its limits and the barking of the charlatans Œ the wicked scholars Œ rose upon the pulpits of deviance, it became necessary to face their declarations with a declaration, but one 46FROM OUR SISTERSof truth, to suppress their falsehood and restrain their tongues.Yes, Allah has opened the lands for His awliy˚™, so they entered and dispersed within the lands, killing the ˛ghters of the kuˆ˚r, capturing their women, and enslaving their children.I write this while the letters drip of pride. Yes, O religions of kufr altogether, we have indeed raided and captured the k˚˛rah women, and drove them like sheep by the edge of the sword. And glory belongs to Allah, to His Messenger, and the believers, but the hypocrites do not know!Or did you and your supporters think we were joking on the day we announced the Khil˚fah upon the prophetic methodology? I swear by my Lord, it is certainly Khil˚fah, as certain as your ability to speak, see, and hear. It is Khil˚fah with everything it contains of honor and pride for the Muslim and humiliation and degradation for the k˚˛r. Our Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, as narrated by Ibn ‚Umar (radiyall˚hu ‚anhum˚), ﬁI was sent with the sword before the Hour so that Allah alone is worshipped without partners. And my provision was placed beneath the shade of my spear. And humiliation and degradation was made for those who oppose my commandﬂ [Reported by Im˚m Ahmad].˜erefore, we did not humiliate them, but it was Allah who did so at the hands of His truthful slaves who did not wish for anything except for Allah™s word to be supreme and the kuˆ˚r™s words to be lowest. For that sake, they have exerted their souls and hearts. ˜eir aim is sublimity for the religion and humiliation of whoever desires a religion other than Islam!‚Abdur-Rahm˚n Ibn Jubayr Ibn Nufayr reported that his father said, ﬁWhen the lands of Cyprus were conquered, the people began to divide the captives. ˜ey separated between them as the captives were weeping for each other. So Abud-Dard˚™ went aside. He then sat down upon the ground and wept. ˜ereupon Jubayr Ibn Nufayr came to him and said, ‚What makes you cry, O Abud-Dard˚™? Do you cry on a day in which Allah has honored Islam and its people and humiliated ﬁI swear by my Lord, it is certainly Khil˚fah, as certain as your ability to speak, see, and hear.ﬂ47dabiqkufr and its people?™ ˜en he replied, ‚May your mother be bereaved of you, O Jubayr Ibn Nufayr! How despicable are the people to Allah if they abandon His command. Were they not a manifest and powerful nation overpowering the people? ˜ey reigned until they abandoned Allah™s command, so they ended up as you see them now. Indeed when slavery befalls a people, then they have left Allah™s favor, so Allah has no need for them™ﬂ [Sunan Sa™˝d Ibn M˜erefore, I further increase the spiteful ones in anger by saying that I and those with me at home prostrated to Allah in gratitude on the day the ˛rst slave-girl entered our home. Yes, we thanked our Lord for having let us live to the day we saw kufr humiliated and its banner destroyed. Here we are today, and after centuries, reviving a prophetic Sunnah, which both the Arab and non-Arab enemies of Allah had buried. By Allah, we brought it back by the edge of the sword, and we did not do so through paci˛sm, negotiations, democracy, or elections. We established it according to the prophetic way, with blood-red swords, not with ˛ngers for voting or tweeting.As for those who rebuked the Khil˚fah™s soldiers for saby, then this is not surprising at all, for they themselves are those who crippled the obligation of jih˚d with false suspicions and crooked arguments. ˜ey are the same beards and their sheep-like followers. Why should we criticize them now? Isn™t it su˙cient for us to know of their sinful sitting back that has bloated their potbellies and increased their weakness abundantly?˜ey fear to speak up about a principle of the religion Œ the ro do we then expect from them a word of truth on a secondary matter of the religion? Even the testimony of ﬁ˜ere is no god but Allah,ﬂ they obscure it and don™t proclaim it openly, fearing that the cruelty of the tyrants Œ those they ally with instead of Allah Œ might reach them. ˜ey forgot the command of the All-Powerful to His slave Muhammad (sallall˚hu alayhi wa sallam), {So declare what you are commanded} [Al-Hijr: 94]. Allah the One and Only is the commander and not Ibn Sa Ibn ZAEﬂ), nor Ibn Mawzah atar), nor anyone else. And all of these rulers are stepchildren of the White House.˜ey said one day that there™s no jih˚d, then a group of believers established Œ with Allah™s strength alone Œ the Khil˚fah upon the prophetic methodology. Today they say no to saby, while some slave-girls in our State are now pregnant and some of them have even been set free for Allah™s sake and got married in the courts of the Islamic State after becoming Muslims and practicing Islam well. Our father Ibr˚h˝m (‚alayhis-sal˚m) took H˚jar as a concubine and she bore him Ism˚™˝l (‚alayhis-sal˚m) and our Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) took M˚riyah as a concubine and she bore him a son whom he named Ibr˚h˝m. It was reported that Zayd1 Ibn ‚Al˝ once entered upon Hish˚m Ibn ‚Abdil-Malik. Hish˚m told him, ﬁIt has reached me that you are entertaining hopes of becoming Khal˝fah. But you are not ˛t for it as you are the son of a slave-girl!ﬂ So Zayd replied, ﬁAs for your statement that I am entertaining hopes of becoming Khal˝fah Œ then no one knows the unseen except Allah. And as for me being the son of a slave-girl, then Ism˚™˝l was the son of a slave-girl, and Allah made the best of mankind, Muhammad, from his progeny.ﬂIbn Kath˝r (rahimahull˚h) mentioned that ﬁal-Husayn (Ibn ‚Al˝ Ibn Ab˝ T˚lib) didn™t have any male descendants except from ‚Al˝ Ibn al-Husayn and ‚Al˝ Ibn al-Husayn didn™t have progeny except from his paternal cousin the daughter of al-Hasan, so Marwan Ibn al-Hakam said to him, ‚If only you took concubines, your children would be more.™ He replied, saying, ‚I cannot aˆord concubines.™ So he gave him a loan of a hundred thousand. He then bought concubines with it and they bore him more oˆspring. After Marw˚n became sick, he decreed in his will that nothing of which he had lent to ‚Al˝ Ibn al-Husayn may be taken. ˜us, all of al-Husayn™s descendants are from ‚Al˝ Ibn al-Husayn™s progeny, rahimahull˚hﬂ [Al-Bid˚yah wan-Nih˚yah].Rather, let me add to the heartache of the spiteful. 1 Editor™s Note: His father was ‚Al˝ Ibn al-Husayn Ibn ‚Al˝ Ibn Ab˝ T˚lib al-H˚shim˝ al-Quras-h˝ and his mother was a Sind˝ slave-girl whom his father himself possessed and took as a concubine.48FROM OUR SISTERSIndeed, from the slave-girls are those that after saby turned into hard-working, diligent seekers of knowledge after she found in Islam what she couldn™t ˛nd in kufr, despite the slogans of ﬁfreedomﬂ and ﬁequality.ﬂ Indeed it is our pure Islam, which upraises every lowly-one and puts an end to every de˛ciency.Aurayrah (radiyall˚hu ‚anh) said that Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁAllah marvels at a people who enter Jannah in chainsﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˚r˝].Ibnul-Jawz˝ (rahimahull˚h) said, ﬁ˜is means that they were captured and enchained. Once they realized the truth of Islam they entered it voluntarily, and thus they entered Jannah. So the coercion into captivity and chains was the ˛rst cause. It is as if he referred to coercion (into slavery) with the word chains. And because this was behind them entering Jannah, he regarded it as the causeﬂ [Fath al-B˚r˝ Œ Ibn Hajar].So whoever thinks that the ultimate aim of saby is pleasure, then he is a mistaken ignoramus. Otherwise, why did the Shar˝™ah urge kindness towards slaves as well as good treatment of them even if they are kuˆ˚r whom Allah humiliated by making them into slaves owned by the people of Islam. Yet He (subh˚nah) made their liberation from the lands of kufr a way for their salvation and guidance towards the straight path.Aharr (radiyall˚hu ‚anh) reported that Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ﬁYour brothers whom were placed by Allah into your hands, feed them of what you eat, dress them of what you wear, and do not hold them to account for what they can™t bear. If you hold them to account, then assist them!ﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˚r˝ and Muslim]Aasanh) said, ﬁI struck a young slave of mine and then heard a voice from behind me saying, ‚Know, O Aas that Allah has more power over you than you over him.™  ˜en I turned and saw it was Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam). I then said, ‚O Messenger of Allah, he is free for Allah™s sake.™ So he said, ‚If you hadn™t done so, the ˛re would™ve surely scorched you™ or ‚the ˛re would™ve surely touched you™ [Reported by Muslim].Yes, this is our Œ as they allege Œ ﬁsavageﬂ Islam, ordering us with kindness even towards slaves. ˜is is demanded even if they were to remain upon their kufr. And I swear by Allah, I haven™t heard of nor seen anyone in the Islamic State who coerced his slave-girl to accept Islam. On the contrary, I saw all of those who accepted Islam had done so voluntarily, not against their will. Once she bears witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and begins performing what has been prescribed for her of rites, then we say, ﬁCome and be welcomed.ﬂ As for her heart, then we defer it to Allah (ta™˚l˚).As for those who appeared on the screens of falsehood, claimed to have run away from the Islamic State, made up lies, and wrote false stories, then I say, whoever has read history and studied the S˝rah knows that throughout the times there were devious and wicked slave-girls with stories that would turn a newborn™s hair grey. Hafsah, the Mother of the Believers, (radiyall˚hu ‚anh˚) ordered the killing of one of her slave-girls who had performed sorcery on her, so ‚Abdur-Rahm˚n Ibn Zayd Ibn al-Khatt˚b killed her. ˜e slave-girl of Ibn ‚Umar (radiyall˚hu ‚anhum˚) ran away. Will we thus vilify the people of that time and blame them?!˜ey criticize us for a divine, praiseworthy law and ignore that over which the mountains almost crumble in shock. So woe unto the deceivers, woe unto them!Are slave-girls whom we took by Allah™s command better, or prostitutes Œ an evil you do not denounce Œ who are grabbed by quasi men in the lands of kufr where you live? A prostitute in your lands comes and goes, openly committing sin. She lives by selling her honor, within the sight and hearing of the deviant scholars from whom we don™t hear even a faint sound. As for the slave-girl that was taken by the swords of men following the cheerful warrior 49dabiq(Muhammad Œ sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam), then her enslavement is in opposition to human rights and copulation with her is rape?! What is wrong with you? How do you make such a judgment? What is your religion? What is your law? Rather, tell me who is your lord? Never did the Khil˚fah™s soldiers revive a Sunnah or extinguish a bid™ah except that you shouted with lewdness and heresy! Leave us alone with your burping and wait for a Khil˚fah that Obama comes to you with or whose landmarks A Kurbl˝s) draws up for you! I swear by Allah, O you who feign to be knowledgeable and shout with falsehood in every gathering, surely the slave markets will be established against the will of the politically ﬁcorrectﬂ!And who knows, maybe Michelle Obama™s price won™t even exceed a third of a d˝n˚r, and a third of a d˝n˚r is too much for her!Our last supplication is that all praise belongs to Allah the Lord of the creation and may peace and blessings be upon our leader Muhammad and all his family and companions.50FEATUREPower belongs to Allah entirely. {And [yet], among the people are those who take other than Allah as equals [to Him]. ˜ey love them as they [should] love Allah. But those who believe are stronger in love for Allah. And if only they who have committed injustice would consider [that] when they see the punishment, [they will be certain] that power belongs to Allah entirely and that Allah is severe in punishment} [Al-Baqarah: 165].Honor belongs to Allah entirely. {Give tidings to the hypocrites that there is for them a painful punishment Œ those who take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do they seek with them honor [through might]? But indeed, honor belongs to Allah entirely} [An-Nis˚™: 138-139]. {And let not their speech grieve you.

But to Allah belongs plotting entirely. He knows what every soul earns, and the disbelievers will know for whom is the ˛nal abode} [Ar-Ra™d: 42].No one can escape His power. No one can attain honor except through Him. And no plot can ever truly succeed except His.˜ese are realities that the crusaders have not realized. And so they use their power to tyrannize the weak and oppressed Muslims. ˜eir Jewish, hypocritical, and apostate allies attempt to attain honor and might through the crusaders. And they plot against Islam while having the doubts of J˚hiliyyah, thinking that Allah will not grant victory to His religion–But the matter of victory belongs completely to Allah. {Say, ﬁIndeed, the matter belongs completely to Allahﬂ} [˘l ‚Imr˚n: 154]. {And to Allah belong the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth and to Him will be returned the matter completely, so worship Him and rely upon Him. And your Lord is not unaware of that which you do} [HAnd He legislated that the religion is for Him And Allah Is the Best of PlottersLessons from the Qur™˚n about Plots51dabiqcompletely and decreed it would be so. {And ˛ght them until there is no ˛tnah and [until] the religion is completely for Allah. And if they cease Œ then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do} [Al-Anf˚l: 39]. {It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religions, even if the mushrik˝n despise such} [At-Tawbah: 33]. {And su˙cient is Allah as a witness} [Al-Fath: 28].But due to the deviance and arrogance of the enemies of Allah, they plot against His religion and His allies. ˜eir plots almost cause the mountains to collapse out of shock that the kuˆ˚r dare to oppose the Lord of the heavens and the earth. {And they had plotted their plot, but with Allah is their plot [recorded], even if their plot had been [su˙cient] to do away with the mountains} [Ibr˚h˝m: 46].And yet their plot is inherently weak, as it is part of the weak plot of Shayt˚n. {˜ose who believe ˛ght in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve o ˛ght against the allies of Shayt˚n. Indeed, the plot of Shayt˚n has ever been weak} [An-Nis˚: 76].And this weakness is due to the power of sincerity Œ the core of tawh˝d Œ granted by Allah to the slaves He has chosen, as the accursed Shayt˚n himself testi˛ed. {[Ibl˝s] said, ﬁMy Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely make [disobedience] attractive to them on earth, and I will mislead them all except, among them, Your sincere servants.ﬂ [Allah] said, ﬁ˜is is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight. Indeed, My servants Œ no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviatorsﬂ} [Al-Hijr: 39-42].And despite their weakness and the weakness of their master, Shayt˚n, they plotted for his sake. And so they became the object of the ˛rm plot of the best and swiftest of plotters, without them realizing it. {And they plotted, but Allah plotted. And Allah is the best of plotters} [˘l ‚Imr˚n: 54]. {˜en did they feel secure from the plot of Allah? But no one feels secure from the plot of Allah except those people in loss} [Al-A™r˚f: 99]. {And when We give the people a taste of mercy after adversity has touched them, at once they plot against Our verses.

But you will never ˛nd in the way of Allah any change, and you will never ˛nd in the way of Allah any alteration} [F˚tir: 43].So a Muslim should not grieve when hearing about the weak plots of the kuˆ˚r. Rather, he should be patient and certain of the kuˆ˚r™s imminent destruction. His strongest weapon is his tawh˝d and what it entails of relying upon Allah alone, fearing Him alone, supplicating Him alone, and declaring his bar˚™ah from the mushrik˝n. {And if you are patient and fear Allah, their plot will not harm you at all. Indeed, Allah is encompassing of what they do} [˘l ‚Imr˚n: 120]. {And be patient, and your patience is not but through Allah. And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they plot} [An-Nahl: 127]. {Say, ﬁCall your ‚partners™ and then conspire against me and give me no respite. Indeed, my protector is Allah, who has sent down the Book; and He is an ally to the righteous. And those you call upon besides Him are unable to help you, nor can they help themselvesﬂ} [Al-A™r˚f: 195-197]. {He said, ﬁIndeed, I call Allah to witness, and witness [yourselves] that I am free from whatever you ascribe to Him of partners.

He should remind himself and others with these lessons so that he does not degrade himself before their weak plots nor succumb to the shirk˝ belief in extreme conspiracy theories1.On 25 Rajab 1436, the Khal˝fah (ha˛dhahull˚h) addressed the Ummah in a speech titled ﬁMarch Forth Whether Light or Heavyﬂ in which he brieˇy mentioned the background of a new plot against Islam in the making. He ˛rst warned against the attitude that led many of the militant factions into apostatizing and allying with the kuˆ˚r, and that is their willingness to compromise and hope for permanent peace with the crusaders. He said, ﬁO Muslims! Whoever thinks that it is within his capacity to conciliate with the Jews, Christians, and other kuˆ˚r, and for them to conciliate with him, such that he coexists with them and they coexist with him while he is upon his religion and upon tawh˝d, then he has belied the explicit statement of his Lord (‚azza wa jall), who says, – {And they will continue to ˛ght you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able} [Al-Baqarah: 217] – So this is the condition of the kuˆ˚r in dealing with the Muslims until the establishment of the Hour. {And you will never ˛nd in the way of Allah any alteration} [F˚tir: 43].ﬂHe also said, ﬁO Muslims, Islam was never for a day the religion of peace.

He fought both the Arabs and non-Arabs in all their various colors. He himself left to ˛ght and took part in dozens of battles. He never for a day grew tired of war – His companions after him and their followers carried on similarly. ˜ey did not soften nor abandon war, until they possessed the Earth, conquered the East and the West, the nations submitted to them, and the lands yielded to them, by the edge of the sword. And similarly, this will remain the condition of those who follow them until the Day of Recompense. Our Prophet (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) has informed us of the Mal˚him near the end of time. He gave us good tidings and promised us that we would be victorious in these battles. He is the truthful and trustworthy, sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam. And here we are today seeing the signs of those Mal˚him and we feel the winds of victory within them.ﬂHe explained that the Muslims would not cease to ˛ght pars˚ (‚alayhis-sal˚m) descends and leads the Muslim armies. He said, ﬁIndeed, ˛ghting the kuˆ˚r, hijrah, and jih˚d will remain until the establishment of the Hour. Allah™s Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) said, ‚Hijrah will not cease to exist until repentance ceases to be accepted, and repentance will not cease to be accepted until the sun rises from the West™ [Reported by Aom Mu™˚wiyah] – He (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) also said, ‚˜ere will not cease to exist a group from my nation ˛ghting upon the truth, manifest until the Day of Judgment. s˚, son of Maryam, will descend, and their leader will say, ‚Come and lead us in prayer.™ So he will say, ‚No. You are leaders over one another as an honor from Allah for this nation™™ [Reported by Muslim from J˚bir].ﬂThe crusader Obama and his t˜gh˚t ally Salm˜n Ibn ‚Abdil-™Az˛zFaysal Ibn al-Husayn poses with his crusader masters. The apostates of today are no diˆerent than the apostates of yesterday.54FEATUREHe described the imminent extinction of the grayzone by saying, ﬁAnd if the Crusaders today claim to avoid the Muslim public and to con˛ne themselves to targeting the armed amongst them, then soon you will see them targeting every Muslim everywhere. And if the Crusaders today have begun to trouble the Muslims who continue to live in the lands of the cross by monitoring them, arresting them, and questioning them, then soon they will begin to displace them and take them away either dead, imprisoned, or homeless. ˜ey will not leave anyone amongst them except one who apostatizes from his religion and follows is merely the spearhead in this war. It is but the war of the people of faith against the people of kufr, so march forth to your war O Muslims. March forth everywhere, for it is an obligation upon every Muslim who is accountable before Allah – ˜ere is no excuse for any Muslim who is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, or capable of carrying a weapon where he is, for Allah (tab˚raka wa ta™˚l˚) has commanded him with hijrah and jih˚d, and has made ˛ghting obligatory upon him. And we call upon every Muslim in every place to perform hijrah to the Islamic State or ˛ght in his land wherever that may be.ﬂThe t˜gh˚t of Qatar, third from right, stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the crusader Obama and a host of other apostatestheirs. And you will remember what I now say to you, and I entrust my aˆair to Allah. O Muslims, the Jews, the Christians, and the rest of the kuˆ˚r will not approve of you nor abandon waging war against you until you follow their religion and apostatize from yours.ﬂHe then expounded on the obligation upon the Muslims during these wars before the Hour. He said, ﬁO Muslims! Do not think the war that we are waging is the Islamic State™s war alone. Rather, it is the Muslims™ war altogether. It is the war of every Muslim in every place, and the Islamic State ˜is is the order of the Khal˝fah (ha˛dhahull˚h). Either ones performs hijrah to the wil˚y˚t of the Khil˚fah or, if he is unable to do so, he must attack the crusaders, their allies, the R˚˛dah, the taw˚gh˝t, and their apostate forces, wherever he might be with any means available to him, and he should not hesitate in doing so, nor consult any supposed ﬁscholarﬂ on this obligation. He should attack after declaring his bay™ah to the Khil˚fah, so as not to die a death of J˚hiliyyah. And he will ˛nd an excellent example in the shuhad˚™ of the Islamic State including Numan Haider and Man Haron Monis (Australia), Michael Zehaf-55dabiqBibeau and Martin Couture-Rouleau (Canada), Zale ˜ompson, Elton Simpson, and Nadir Soo˛ (America), Amedy Coulibaly (France), Omar Abdel Hamid el-Hussein (Denmark), and So˛ane Amghar and Khalid Ben Larbi (Belgium).He then warned against the propaganda of the crusaders by saying, ﬁAmerica and its allies from amongst the Jews, Crusaders, R˚˛dah, secularists, atheists, and apostates claim that their coalition and war is to aid the weak and oppressed, help the poor, relieved, defend the innocent and peaceful, and prevent the shedding of their blood. ˜ey also claim to be in the camp of truth, good, and justice, waging war against falsehood, evil, and oppression, alongside the Muslims! Rather, they claim to defend Islam and the Muslims! Indeed, they lie.ﬂHulers who tyrannize the Muslim lands with manmade laws and prostrate to the Crusaders. He said, ﬁO Mulers who rule your lands – are the allies of the Jews and Crusaders. Rather, they are their slaves, servants, and guard dogs, and nothing else. ˜e armies that they prepare and arm and which the Jews and Crusaders train are only to crush you, weaken you, enslave you to the Jews and Crusaders, turn you away from your religion and the path of Allah, plunder the goods of your lands, and rob you of your wealth. ˜is reality has become as obvious as the sun in the middle of the day.ﬂHe then expounded in detail on the apathy of the ulers towards the Muslims and followed by saying, ﬁ˜e Arabian Peninsula™s rulers have been exposed and disgraced and have lost their supposed ‚legitimacy.™ ˜eir treachery has become clear even to the laymen of the Muslims. And the reality of these rulers thereby became apparent. ˜erefore, their masters from amongst the Jews and Crusaders had no more use for them. And so their masters began to replace them with the Safaw˝ R˚˛dah and the Kurdish atheists. When ˘l Sealized their masters™ abandonment of them, their disposal of them like tattered shoes, and their replacement of them, they launched their supposed war against the R˚˛dah of Yemen. And it is not a storm of resolve, rather it is the kick of a dying person, by Allah™s permission, as he struggles during his last breaths.ﬂHe then said, ﬁToday they claim to defend Ahlus-Sunnah in Yemen against the R˚˛dah! Rather, they have lied, failed, and lost. ˜eir war is nothing but an attempt to prove themselves once again to their masters from amongst the Jews and Crusaders. It is nothing but a desperate attempt to turn the Muslims away from the Islamic State whose voice The crusaders seek to bridge their relations with R˜˝d˛ Iran at the expense of crusader relations with the Arab taw˜gh˛t56FEATUREis high everywhere and whose reality has become clear to all the Muslims and therefore the Muslims began to gradually rally around it. ˜eir storm is nothing but a storm of delusion after the ˛re of the R˚˛dah scorched their thrones and after the R˚˛dah™s march reached the people of the Arabian Peninsula, a matter that will lead thereafter to the Muslim public in the Arabian Peninsula rallying around the Islamic State since it defends them against the R˚˛dah. ˜is is what frightens ˘l S and the rulers of the Arabian Peninsula and makes their thrones tremble. ˜is is the secret of their supposed ‚storm,™ which, by Allah™s permission, will be their imminent end, for ˘l S rulers of the Arabian Peninsula are not people of war nor do they have the patience for it. Rather, they are people of luxury and extravagance, people of intoxication, prostitution, dances, and feasts. ˜ey have become accustomed to the defense of the Jews and Crusaders for them and their hearts have drunk humiliation, disgrace, and subservience.ﬂHe also called the Muslims to recognize the reality of this war. ﬁO Muslims everywhere, has the time not come for you to realize the truth of the conˇict and that it is between kufr and ˝m˚n? See on which front the rulers of your lands stand and to which camp they belong. Has the time not come O Ahlus-Sunnah for you to know that you alone are the targets? ˜is war is only against you and against your religion. Has the time not come for you to return to your religion and your jih˚d and thereby bring back your glory, honor, rights, and leadership? Has the time not come for you to know that there is no might nor honor nor safety nor rights for you except in the shade of the Khil˚fah?ﬂHe also demonstrated how the R˚˛dah deal with their apostate ﬁSunn˝ﬂ allies once they no longer have use for them. He said, ﬁO Ahlus-Sunnah in Iraq – seek shelter Œ after Allah Œ with the Islamic State. What do you wait for after the truth has become clearer than the day and after the spiteful R˚˛dah exposed their reality? Here they are today slaughtering everyone considered from Ahlus-Sunnah in Baghdad and elsewhere. No one was saved from them, even their allies, supporters, aids, tails, and dogs from the apostates who had once belonged to Ahlus-Sunnah, those in the Sahwah, army, police, and elsewhere, those whom the evil scholars confused into ˇeeing the implementation of Allah™s law in the territory of the Islamic State. So they became homeless, humiliated, fearful, and worrisome of the R˚˛dah™s cruelty, whereas the Muslims live in the territory of the Islamic State The apostate Sahwah leader Ab˚ R˛shah posing with his master, Bush Jr.57dabiqwith might and honor, secure by Allah™s bounty alone, with a life of comfort, going about the aˆairs of their business, livelihood, and trade, enjoying the grace of living under the rule of their Lord™s law, and all praise and grace is Allah™s. ˜erefore, O Muslims, seek shelter Œ after Allah Œ with the Islamic State.ﬂHe also warned of the possible attempt of the kuˆ˚r to strike against the Islamic State wil˚y˚t in Sh˚m before those in Iraq. ﬁBe patient and ˛rm, and be cautious, for the enemies of Allah are mobilizing, thundering, increasing, and threatening the people of Mosul. We believe that their mobilization will be for ar-Raqqah and Halab before Mosul. So be cautious.ﬂFinally, he explained the growing weakness of the modern crusaders. ﬁO soldiers of the Islamic State, be ˛rm, for you are upon the truth. Seek help through patience, for victory comes with patience and triumph is for those who are patient. Be patient, because the Crusaders are bleeding to death, the R˚˛dah are faltering, and the Jews are horri˛ed and in dread. Your enemies have become weaker than they were yesterday Œ by Allah™s grace Œ and are growing weaker and weaker, and all praise be to Allah.ﬂIn his words there is a summary on this ˛nal plot Œ insh˚™all˚h Œ of the crusaders and their apostate allies before the major malhamah.First, the crusaders have become too weak to wage their own wars. ˜is is due to the blessed operations of September 11th and the subsequent jih˚d in both Afghanistan and Iraq. ˜ey are too weak ˛nancially, militarily, and psychologically to ˛ght another war, although there is no doubt that they will eventually ˛ght the Muslims at D˚biq after the crusaders™ betrayal of an impending truce. Because of their weakness, they have been forced to rely upon their allies and agents to ˛ght their wars. In Iraq, since the collapse of the apostate Ba™th raddam, their allies were the Kurdish atheists from the Peshmerga, the Safaw˝2 government forces, the Safaw˝ militias, and the ﬁSunn˝ﬂ Sahwah of apostasy. Over time, the ﬁSunn˝ﬂ Sahwah was abandoned for the sake of a stable central Safaw˝ regime. ˜e Sahwah was not wholly trusted since some of its factions had at one time in the past participated in the war against the Crusaders and their R˚˛d˝ allies. Accordingly, after the withdrawal of American forces, the Sahwah was betrayed by its former Safaw˝ ally, and so many of its members found themselves imprisoned and tortured by the R˚˛dah they once had served.In Sh˚m, initially the crusaders had con˛dence in the Free Syrian Army (FSA), which belongs to the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) interim ﬁgovernment.ﬂ But the crusaders were surprised to ˛nd much of the military and non-military aid they provided to these factions being sold to merchants and arms dealers and eventually ending up with the Islamic State. What was not sold by the crusaders™ unreliable agents would ultimately be taken as war-booty by the Khil˚fah™s army. ˜e crusaders could not rely upon the FSA, as it was too corrupt and lacked a coherent leadership. So their major ally in the region became the Kurdish atheists belonging to the PKK Œ the allies of the ashar. ˜roughout the early years of the modern events in Sh˚m, the PKK ruled parts of Halab, ar-Raqqah, and al-Barakah in agreement with the Nusayr˝ regime, and were tasked by Bashar with crushing the Muslims revolting against his regime in these regions. ˜e PKK was in essence a Kurdish Shabb˝hah and continues to be so in areas they control. But because they were more coherent as an organization and because they were more ﬁideologicallyﬂ driven, the crusaders favored them over the FSA.So the crusaders relied upon the Kurdish allies of the R˚˛dah in Iraq (the Peshmerga) and upon the Kurdish allies of the Nusayriyyah in Sh˚m (the PKK). Also, their policy of backing the Safaw˝ regime in Iraq and negotiating with the Safaw˝ 2 ˙is word is in reference to the apostate Safavid dynasty Œ S˝f˛ R˜˘d˛ Persians who ruled parts of Afghanistan, Sh˜m, the Arabian Gulf, the South Caucasus, Persia, Iraq, Sh˜m, Turkey, Balochistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. ˙ese R˜˘d˛ rulers forced their religion upon the lands they conquered. ˙is eventually led to the majority of modern-day ﬁIranﬂ adopting this apostasy.An Analysis of the Doomed Plot58FEATUREleadership in Iran gave the R˚˛dah the strength and con˛dence to mobilize internationally. ˜e R˚˛dah quickly took parts of Yemen. ˜e Syrian regime was already an ally of Iran. Lebanon was largely under the control of R˚˛d˝ militias. And with large R˚˛d˝3 populations in Bahrain, Kuwait, and ﬁSaudiﬂ Arabia (in the Eastern Province Œ Qat˝f, Damm˚m, al-Ahs˚™ Œ Najr˚n, and even al-Mad˝nah), smaller R˚˛d˝ populations in Qatar and the UAE, and the Ib˚d˝ population of Oman all ready to move, the Arab taw˚gh˝t felt their thrones threatened. Meanwhile, the Turkish taw˚gh˝t worried about the aspirations of the crusaders™ Kurdish allies and the opposition to the  Erdogan regime based in the R˚˛d˝ minority of Turkey. ˜e olonged wars in Yemen and Sh˚m would strengthen the Islamic State, as this would expose the coldness and treachery of the taw˚gh˝t and prove the Islamic State was the sole defender of Ahlus-Sunnah against the R˚˛dah and atheists.3 ˜is includes the R˚˛d˚h of the Zaydiyyah, Ism˚™˝liyyah, and Im˚miyyah.Quickly, the taw˚gh˝t of Turkey, ˘l Satar Œ the triad of apostasy Œ mobilized without seeking permission from their crusader masters. ˜ey gained support from the Arab and non-Arab taw˚gh˝t of Bahrain, Kuwait, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, Bangladesh, Sudan, Pakistan, and Segime of Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi against the R˚˛dah of the Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen. And despite the crusaders™ former claim of the R˚˛d˝ Houthis not being linked to Iran, the crusaders pledged their support for the operation.Turkey then requested from its Sahwah allies in Halab Œ addicted to Turkish aid Œ to begin a war against the PKK in parts of the region, after a long truce had been observed by the PKK and the Sahwah factions including the Jawl˚n˝ front. ˜e apostate triad Œ Turkey, ˘l S Qatar Œ also funneled aid to a newly formed coalition of factions addicted t Œ ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ4 Œ to wage war against the Nusayr˝ regime in Idlib and al-Q ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ quickly added to its priorities a war against the Islamic State in al-Q of this aid is a matter to which the FSA, SNC, the apostate triad, the crusaders, and even member factions of ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ (such as Faylaq ash-Sh˚m) admitted. ˜e Sahwah factions including the Jawl˚n˝ front moved against the muj˚hid˝n of Dar™˚ whom they accused of being Khaw˚rij. A coalition of ﬁIslamistﬂ factions similar to ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ was quickly formed in Halab. And suddenly the Sahwah factions were advancing upon the Nusayriyyah in Latakia and elsewhere, while the favored ﬁrebelﬂ allies of the 4 Read about a major member faction of this coalition in the article titled ﬁ˙e Allies of al-Q˜™idah: Part 2ﬂ in this issue.R˜˝d˛ Houthis in YemenQatar˛ and Turkish apostates posing with the crusader John Kerry59dabiqcrusaders in Sh˚m Œ the FSA Œ proved themselves unreliable militarily.Meanwhile, the apostate triad began to withdraw vocal support for the Safaw˝ regime in Iraq, fearing its long-term ambitions would disturb their own thrones. It also called upon the leaders of the ﬁIslamicﬂ Front to gather again in Turkey and discuss developments on the ground in Sh˚m, plots for the future, and the terms of their ﬁunconditionalﬂ support. One of the plots discussed was a ﬁstorm of resolveﬂ in Sh˚m as cover for the Sahwah in its attempts to advance against the Islamic State. Again, the addiction to oblem for the Sahwah factions that facilitates their further drowning in apostasy.˜rough all this, the apostate triad intended to ﬁproveﬂ to their crusader masters that they were still essential to the future of the region, that they had the power to inˇuence the outcome there, and that their opinion mattered when it came to American-R˚˛d˝ relations and the issue of R˚˛d˝ nuclear ambitions. Essentially, it was greed, fear, and envy which moved them. ˜ey wanted themselves, not the R˚˛dah, to be the favored allies of their crusaders.˜is competition between the crusaders and the taw˚gh˝t, between the ﬁSunn˝ﬂ apostates and the R˚˛dah, between the FSA and the ﬁIslamicﬂ Front, between the Jawl˚n˝ front and the nationalist factions, between the Jawl˚n˝ front and the ﬁIslamicﬂ factions, and between the Kurdish atheists and the ﬁoppositionﬂ factions, is all indicative of the imminent breakdown of their plots. {You think they are together, but their hearts are diverse. ˜at is because they are a people who do not reason} [Al-Hashr: 14].˜e crusaders will ultimately ˛nd they cannot face the Islamic State except directly, face-to-face, or else Œ due to their nonstop bleeding Œ the crusaders will be forced to disengage from their war against the Muslims until the time decreed by Allah for al-Malhamah al-Kubr˚.O Allah, revealer of the Book, swiftest to account, mover of the clouds, vanquish the parties, make them tremble, and grant us victory over them.Sahwah-supporter ‚Abdull˜h al-Muhaysin˛A k˜˝r Druze ˝ghter in the ranks of the Sahw˜tThree main Sahwah leaders visit Turkey to meet with the taw˜gh˛t of the region60ENEMY˚S WORDSIn an article for Foreign Aˆairs published on ﬁ13 February 2014,ﬂ he said, ﬁ˜e United States should also relax its conditions for cooperation with the Islamic Front and even consider closer contact with JN [ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ] as they both work to bring down Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ˜at will put even more pressure on ISIS, while allowing the United States and the Islamist groups to get familiar with each other, understand each other™s perspectives and fears, and possibly even mitigate human suˆering in Syria. ˜ose ties would surely be valuable when it comes time to reconstruct the country.ﬂ (Note: ˜e ﬁIslamicﬂ Front was already cooperating with the agents of the US Œ Qatar, Turkey, and the Saudis Œ but not directly and openly then with the US itself.)˜is concept was graphically mapped out by the crusaders of the Wall Street Journal on ﬁ29 August 2014ﬂ in a piece titled ﬁUnited Against Islamic State.ﬂ ˜ey explained the map by brieˇy saying, ﬁFear over the spread of Islamic State means parties often at odds now share a common enemy– Parties that display friction or outright aggression toward one another are ˛nding themselves aligned in a desire to counter Islamic State– ˜e greatest odd bedfellow of all: Islamic State threatens al-Qaeda as well as the West, meaning that, in fact, al-Qaeda and the US now have a shared enemy.ﬂ˜e crusaders of the Small Wars Journal described the phenomenon brieˇy on ﬁ22 March 2015,ﬂ ﬁOur rebel allies are predominately Sunni-based and include a healthy dose of Al-Qaida Œ our sworn enemy in Ira[q] and Afghanistan has somehow managed to be on our side in Syria.ﬂAnd after it being merely a merging of interests against the Islamic State Œ not against kuˆ˚r Œ diˆerent crusaders began to emphasize the need for a proper building of such a relationship.A major crusader think-tank Œ the Carnegie Endowment Œ wrote on ﬁ24 March 2015,ﬂ ﬁ˜e West currently sees the Nusra Front as a threat. But Nusra™s pragmatism and ongoing evolution mean that it could become an ally in the ˛ght against the Islamic State. – Instead of putting Nusra and the Islamic State in the same basket, the West should look beyond the Nusra Front™s ideological a˙liation and encourage its pragmatism as it seeks an end to the Syrian conˇict.ﬂ˜is long piece explains the ﬁpragmatismﬂ of the Jawl˚n˝ front in detail: Cooperation with other factions is unconditional and ﬁideologyﬂ is not imposed by force. ˜e author of the article says in praise of the Jawl˚n˝ front, ﬁ– Nusra does not impose its ideology wholesale.

When one hears that the crusaders now consider this or that party of jih˚d claimants as a potential ally serving the crusaders™ interests against the Islamic State, then wash your hands of that group and ˇee from them with your religion as you would ˇee from a leper!˜e problem is not that the crusaders consider these jih˚d claimants to have a common enemy Œ one whom the Muslims pronounce takf˝r upon, such as the R˚˛dah, the Nusayriyyah, the secularists, and the proponents of democracy– and whom the crusaders fear more than the Muslims for material reasons, such as their Safaw˝ enemy™s desire to produce nuclear weapons. But rather, they consider their common enemy to be the Islamic State that the shah˝d leaders these jih˚d claimants ascribe themselves to had praised repeatedly.Below you will ˛nd the words of crusader think-tanks, analysts, advisors, and journalists, suggesting to their American crusader leadership the necessity of preserving jih˚d-claimant heads and parties and the building of relationships with them because in doing so they would serve the crusade against the Islamic State.Amongst the ˛rst to present this idea to the American crusader leadership was the Jew Barak Mendelsohn. 61dabiqpragmatism. ˜e group has been collaborating with a wide variety of local forces that are not pushed to ˛ght under its umbrella.

Its most eˆective way of establishing itself is not by attacking across the border, but by coopting Jordanian extremist factions and exploiting the simmering social discontent among Jordanian youth. To counter these trends, the government has sought to exploit divisions between al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, releasing some clerics [al-Maqdis˝ and al-Filist˝n˝] aligned with the former group and allowing them a degree of media visibility.ﬂ˜is policy was even suggested for Afghanistan and Pakistan, as the Islamic State™s presence there threatened regional stability. ˜e crusaders of War on the Rocks wrote on ﬁ13 April 2015,ﬂ ﬁ˜is much is clear, however: Mullah Omar still matters Œ especially in South Asia, where two important developments are playing out. Both are directly tied to stability, which is Washington™s chief interest in the region. And regardless of his fate, Mullah Omar will have an impact on each of them.

Taken at face value, this reasoning suggests that Washington is simply not that concerned about him anymore – ˜en again, the US decision not to go after Omar may be an indication that it still regards him as relevant and useful. Washington may conclude that any and all roads to peace talks in Afghanistan lead through him, and that apprehending or attacking him would be a strategic disaster.ﬂWorst of all, Barak Mendelsohn wrote an article titled ﬁAccepting Al Qaeda Œ ˜e Enemy of the United States™ Enemyﬂ for Foreign Aˆairs on ﬁ9 March 2015.ﬂ In it, he said, ﬁSince 9/11, Washington has considered al Qaeda the greatest threat to the United States, one that must be eliminated regardless of cost or time. After Washington killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, it made Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda™s new leader, its next number one target. But the instability in the Middle East following the Arab revolutions and the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) require that Washington rethink its policy toward al Qaeda, particularly its targeting of Zawahiri. Destabilizing al Qaeda at this time may in fact work against US eˆorts to defeat ISIS.ﬂﬁ– Today, al Qaeda, although still a grave threat, is only one of several emanating from the Middle East. Washington must not only contain Iran™s hegemonic aspirations, which threaten US allies, but also ˛ght ISIS™ expansion. Washington™s failure to balance these diverging interests became apparent when it made the mistake of coupling the bombing of ISIS targets in Syria with attacks on al Qaeda™s Khorasan group –ﬂﬁIn order for US President Barack Obama to ful˛ll his promise to ‚degrade and ultimately destroy™ ISIS, he must weaken ISIS™ control of Mosul, Raqqa, and other large population centers, as well as stop its expansion. Inadvertently, the administration™s cautious approach to military intervention makes al Qaeda Œ which views ISIS as a renegade oˆshoot Œ an important player in curtailing ISIS™ growth.ﬂﬁ– As long as Zawahiri is alive, the leaders of al Qaeda™s branches who are beholden to him by personal oath are less likely to shift allegiances and join ISIS. But if and when Washington succeeds in The Taliban under the shade of the taw˜gh˛t63dabiqkilling Zawahiri, the leaders of al Qaeda™s branches would have the opportunity to reassess whether to remain with al Qaeda or join Baghdadi™s caliphate –ﬂﬁMore so than during the bin Laden era, al Qaeda™s cohesiveness depends on the ability of its leadership to hold the various franchises together, and it is unclear whether al Qaeda can endure another succession since al Qaeda™s veteran leaders have dwindled considerably in recent years, making it more dependent on old guard ˛gures such as Zawahiri to maintain unity. As such, the group™s fate may depend on Zawahiri™s personal survival. It is certainly ironic that at this point, when the United States is the closest it has ever been to destroying al Qaeda, its interests would be better served by keeping the terrorist organization aˇoat and Zawahiri alive.ﬂStrange BedfellowsParties that display friction or outright ag-gression toward one another are ˝nding themselves aligned in a desire to counter Islamic State.

Either they merge into a single entity with the diˆer backed factions in a manner similar to ﬁthe Libyan Dawnﬂ or they await betrayal at the hands of their allies just as the Jawl˚n˝ front had before betrayed the muh˚jir˝n and ans˚r of the Islamic State.The crusaders John McCain and Lindsey Graham call for protective zones defending al-Q˜™idah and its allies against the Islamic State!66INTERVIEWIn light of the victories this month in Wil˚yat Dimashq (Damascus) as the Islamic State continues to advance towards the future stronghold of the believers during the Mal˚him, D˚biq presented a number of questions to the am˝r of the region encompassing the Y Camp in the Wil˚yah. ˜e questions and answers are provided below.67dabiqD˜biq: When did the siege begin on the Yarm˚k Camp and how did it a˛ect the people of the camp?Yarm˚k: All praise belongs to Allah, the Strong, the Exalted. May blessings and peace be upon the cheerful warrior and upon his companions and family. As to what follows: O Allah, there is nothing easy except what You made easy and You make sadness easy if You will. O Allah bestow us with shah˚dah for Your cause purely for Your noble face.In reality, the total siege of South Dimashq began four years ago. An exception to that siege was the Y. ˜e regime conspired with Free Syrian Army leaders in the region to keep the camp open in order to empty the huge storehouses found in the district of ‚Aqrab˚ and Bayt Sahm. ˜ese areas were stores for the regime in which it would store staple food supplies like sugar, rice, bulgur, and so on, and it would use the Y Camp as a passage to move these food supplies out of the storehouses.˜e regime worked according to this evil plan for about a year, until it was sure the storehouses and huge factories were completely emptied and nothing remained in the area except for scarce quantities su˙cing the Muslims for a month or two. ˜e work was completed under the gaze of Akn˚f Bayt al-Maqdis and they were the ones supervising the only passage into the camp. ˜e passage was closed on 15 Ramad˚n 1433, and it was at that time that hunger started assaulting the Muslims™ bodies and death started reaping their souls until more than 170 people died due to lack of supplies and hunger.D˜biq: What is the relationship between Akn˜f Bayt al-Maqdis and Hamas? Did Hamas take part militarily, operationally, politically, or through propaganda, in the war against the Islamic State?Yarm˚k: Akn˚f Bayt al-Maqdis is Hamas™ branch in South Dimashq. ˜is faction was established during the beginning of the events in Sh˚m for a fundamental aim, which was the creation of an internal force considered ﬁrevolutionariesﬂ who at the same time act as guards defending regime-controlled Dimashq; and Akn˚f succeeded in this task. As for what concerns the relationship between Hamas and Akn˚f, the names of the three The apostate leader of Hamas, Ism˜™˛l Haniyyah, with his ally Khamenei, leader of the R˜˝dah68INTERVIEWleaders who founded this faction are as follows. Aa™far, the general commander of Akn˚f Bayt al-Maqdis, is a known personality in Hamas. A Ahmad az-Zwn as ﬁthe Chancellor,ﬂ is the military commander. His previous position in Hamas was the personal bodyguard of Kh˚lid Mash™al. Nid˚l AAl˚, the founding member of Akn˚f, used to work as a personal escort for the prominent Hamas leader, AarWe have the conversations of a person called ﬁA Suhaybﬂ Yahy˚ Hawr˚n˝. He is the commander of ash-Shat˚t camp and he is the connecting link between Hamas and Akn˚f™s general commander Aa™far. ˜ese conversations expose the support sent to Akn˚f by Hamas.As for Akn˚f™s war against the Islamic State, at the time of the Islamic State™s announcement, Akn˚f did not dare to wage war against the Islamic State militarily. However, it was content with ˛ghting the Islamic State ideologically, politically, and through propaganda. But after the announcement of the Islamic Khil˚fah on 1 Ramad˚n 1435 and due to the greed of the factions and Sahw˚t found in the region, Akn˚f participated for the ˛rst time militarily in the war against the Islamic State. ˜e ˛ght persisted for about 8 months. At that time, we were short in numbers while the Sahw˚t heavily outnumbered us. But by Allah™s grace alone, we were able to expel them from al-Hajar al-Aswad, the stronghold of the Islamic State in Dimashq. We inˇicted on them large human losses, leaving more than 300 of their soldiers wounded and killed. Most of their wounded went to the regime™s hospitals for treatment.D˜biq: What was the agreement between Akn˜f Bayt al-Maqdis and the Nusayr˝ regime? What are the details of the ﬁreconciliationﬂ1 the two sides almost executed?Yarm˚k: ˜e agreement was to make the Y Camp neutral in the ongoing conˇict in the region, and to hand it over to the Palestinian factions that were allied with the Nusayr˝ regime represented by Ahmed Jibr˝l™s ﬁGeneral Commandﬂ militia, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), and some of the other factions. ˜e ﬁChancellorﬂ AAhmad was tasked with the job of the negotiations and handover. He was assigned by Aa™far and began the cooperation in a public fashion near the end of the plot. Our security sources are certain about this betrayal. ˜e 1 ˙is term refers to the plot between various Sahwah factions and the regime whereby the Sahwah hands over its territory to the regime after being guaranteed privileges for their treachery.The taw˜gh˛t of Palestine and Qatar69dabiqmatter evolved into smuggling in ammunitions and military equipment via aid cartons, and this is what compelled us to quickly intervene and defeat the mission.D˜biq: After the Islamic State took over the camp, there were contradictory reports about the soldiers of the Akn˜f faction. Some of the reports claimed that they surrendered themselves to the Nusayr˝ regime. Others claimed that they repented and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Others claimed that they escaped to the territory of the Nusayr˝ regime and are ˙ghting alongside it against the Islamic State. What exactly happened to this faction? Does it still exist?Yarm˚k: With the Islamic State™s entering of the camp and the powerful strike that it blew to Akn˚f and the rest of the factions in the region, Akn˚f divided into three parts. ˜e ˛rst part surrendered to the Islamic State and saved their blood. ˜eir numbers come close to 70. ˜is was after the situation in front of them became clear and after they witnessed the treason and treachery of Akn˚f with their own eyes, including Akn˚f™s leadership leaving for the regime after being besieged at the outskirts of the camp and their return to the region from the S˝d˝ Miqd˚d passage after being provided with new plans, personnel, and munitions for the ˛ght against the Islamic State. ˜ere are testimonies from some of their members that a˙rm the regime™s supplying them with munitions and food and the entering of regime elements to ˛ght the Islamic State side-by-side with Akn˚f.˜e second part of Akn˚f joined Ahmad Jibr˝l™s ﬁGeneral Commandﬂ militia. ˜ey and the regime are currently ˛ghting at the outskirts of the camp.˜e third part returned with Akn˚f™s leadership to the regions of ﬁreconciliationﬂ: Yald˚, Bab˝l˚, and Bayt Sahm. After they left the camp, the regime returned them to the area via the S˝d˝ Miqd˚d passage and they now ˛ght with Zahr˚n ‚™s militia and the other factions against the Islamic State.D˜biq: ˆere are reports that some of the factions would hoard the food sent to the camp, that a kilogram of rice now costs more than thirteen thousand Syrian pounds, and that hundreds have died out of hunger. Is it true that some of the factions would make income from the siege at the expense of the Muslims in the camp? Who are those leaders and factions?Yarm˚k: After raiding the camp, the Islamic State found repositories belonging to Akn˚f ˛lled up with food supplies that were hoarded after Akn˚f™s assumption of the distribution of food aid to the camp. It isn™t a secret to anyone in the region that the combatant factions like Liw˚™ al-Isl˚m, Ab˚b˝l Hawr˚n and Ser experienced the eˆect of the siege. ˜ey used to store the food for themselves and their ˛ghters, and sometimes the prices would reach record levels. ˜e price for one kilogram of rice and bulgur reached ˛fteen thousand Syrian Pounds. ˜ere is a lot of proof against these factions and we have photos of Liw˚™ al-Isl˚m™s repositories after we raided them in the region of Yald˚. ˜eir repositories were overstuˆed with food supplies. Not only were they ˛lled with essential supplies but with extravagant stuˆ like halva, nuts, seeds, and dates. ˜ese factions have not ceased to trade with the Muslims™ hunger in the regions of ﬁreconciliationﬂ until now and they hoard most of the food supplies that enter the region. ˜e biggest share in these thieveries goes to the ﬁﬂ of the ﬁreconciliation.ﬂ ˜ey even plotted to empty the camp of its Muslim residents by stipulating that food aid only be distributed to the Yeside in the regions of the ﬁreconciliation.ﬂThe Yarm˚k camp before being liberated by the Islamic State70INTERVIEWD˜biq: How did the people of the camp receive the soldiers of the Islamic State?Yarm˚k: Due to the major propaganda war and the deceitful media claims, there was great fear from the Muslims of the camp, as the image conveyed about the Islamic State was that they love killing and slaughter and that they kill people based on suspicions. ˜ey even claimed that the Islamic State would cut oˆ the ˛ngers of those who smoked. Many other older fabrications were also spread by the new enemies of the Islamic State. We witnessed more than one touching event in the ˛rst days of the liberation of the camp. Once, a Muslim woman came out to us with her children and requested us to kill her and not to take her as a slave! Hasbiyall˚hu wa ni™malwak˝l! ˜ereupon we oˆered her bread and aid and clari˛ed things to her. After some days, she returned and defended the Islamic State and said, ﬁBy Allah, I did not see anything but good from them and what they have brought forth for the people of the camp within days hasn™t been provided to us by the factions over years!ﬂD˜biq: How is the condition now in the camp?Yarm˚k: ˜e situation now in the camp is good, and to Allah belongs all praise. Now the camp lives in the shade of the Khil˚fah. ˜e food situation improved, ˛rst by the grace of Allah (‚azza wa jall), and second by the Khil˚fah soldiers entering the camp. But this situation doesn™t suit the Nusayr˝ regime and its agents in the region, so the regime started pounding the camp with hundreds of explosive barrels and rockets and inciting some people to support the slamic State from the camp. ˜ey exerted various forms of pressure from outside and inside. One form of pressure was the deployment of checkpoints between the regions of ﬁreconciliationﬂ and the camp as well as blocking any food supplies for the inhabitants of the camp and al-Hajar al-Aswad from coming in. ˜ey started arresting any youth who belonged to al-Hajar al-Aswad or to the camp. As I mentioned to you before, they also exclusively distributed food aid to the regions of ﬁreconciliation.ﬂ ˜is was accomplished through the ﬁGeneral Commandﬂ militia, as this militia is loyal to the regime.D˜biq: Many of the Muslims are hopeful that the liberation of the camp is a step towards the liberation of Dimashq. How do you see the future of the battle against the Nusayr˝ regime after the liberation of the camp?Yarm˚k: Our ˛rst and fundamental goal is the liberation of Dimashq and the liberation of the YCamp is the ˛rst step for the realization of this aim. However, the matter is not easy, we ask Allah to strengthen us so that we liberate Dimashq, al-Quds, and Rome. But there is a matter that needs to be mentioned and it is that many of the factions in the region were found and created for the protection of regime-controlled Dimashq and to thwart any of our attempts to enter Dimashq. ˜e Islamic State waged war against these factions and uncovered their plans, including those of the ﬁGuards of Dimashqﬂ 4th Division. ˜e Islamic State rose to destroy this division and terminate its leadership, but Allah decreed that the division™s commander, an individual referred to as ﬁBay˚n Maz™al,ﬂ escaped. He now works in one of the regime intelligence departments. ˜e second faction that was founded as an alternative to the 4th Division was Akn˚f and they have been destroyed, by Allah™s grace. ˜e new alternative which has appeared now is Liw˚™ Sahr˚n ‚™s militia and with Allah™s permission their purge from the region is going on now, as well as the preparations for the battle of Dimashq.The Yarm˚k camp after being liberated by the Islamic State71dabiqD˜biq: What is the condition in the areas near the camp such as al-Hajar al-Aswad and Yald˜?Yarm˚k: ˜e southern region of Dimashq is divided into two main parts. ˜e ˛rst part has joined the ﬁreconciliationﬂ with the regime and returned gradually to the control of the regime. ˜is includes Yald˚, Bab˝l˚ and Bayt Sahm, which are dominated by the Sahw˚t and ruled by three personalities whose allegiance is to the Nusayr˝ regime. Delegations from the regime composed of o˙cers and o˙cials enter these regions on a daily basis. All of this occurs under the gaze of those who are called the ﬁmuj˚hid˝nﬂ of ﬁLiw˚™ al-Isl˚mﬂ and the rest of the factions.˜e second part is al-Hajar al-Aswad, al-Y and at-Tad˚mun, which are the areas where the Khil˚fah™s soldiers are present. ˜e ˛ghting there is the most severe, its fronts are ablaze, and the bombing of these areas occurs on a daily basis. By Allah™s grace, these lands are now under the law of Allah.D˜biq: What is the role of ﬁJaysh al-Isl˜m,ﬂ its ﬁIslamicﬂ Front, and Zahr˜n ‚All˚sh in the war against the Islamic State? Is there cooperation between them and the factions of Shabb˝hah and reconciliation?Yarm˚k: ˜e actions of Jaysh al-Isl˚m and the other factions in the region are con˛ned to turning their guns towards the Islamic State and its supporters, while the Sahwah frontiers with the regime are calm. We haven™t observed any conˇict between them (the regime and the Sahwah) for about a year. In addition, as we said earlier, they are safeguarding the ﬁreconciliationsﬂ in the three regions and reserving their forces, weapons, and ammunition for the ˛ght against the Islamic State. ˜e media delegations, including the R˚˛d˝ media channels, enter under the protection of these factions, while the National Defense Force was formed by members of these factions, and their o˙ces are available inside these regions of ﬁreconciliation.ﬂ ˜e convoys of the regime forces enter and exit from the checkpoints of ‚™s ﬁIslamicﬂ Front. All attempts by the Sahw˚t to assault the positions of the Islamic State are initiated with regime airstrikes on those positions. In recent days, we were able to see a large amount of ammunition entering these areas, and exclusively distributed among the factions who ˛ght the Islamic State. It is a point to note that whenever the Sahw˚t start a battle with the Islamic State, support gushes into ﬁreconciledﬂ areas and the supporters pump huge amounts of money to these factions (Jaysh al-Isl˚m, Sh˚m b˚b˝l Hawr˚n) that call themselves moderate.D˜biq: What do the Sahw˜t plan now against Wil˜yat Dimashq in general and the Yarm˚k Camp in particular?Yarm˚k: ˜e formation of coalitions to ˛ght against the Islamic State especially in South Dimashq was witnessed in the last few weeks and months. ˜e enemies of the religion rely mainly on Zahr˚n ‚ who works to execute the plans of the West and its puppets in the Gulf. Recently, Zahr˚n sent a message of reassurance to the West and to his supporters from amongst the taw˚gh˝t of the Gulf through a number of his speeches that were published on social networks, whereby he deployed all his forces to ˛ght the Islamic State, leaving behind all his frontiers with the regime in total calm and not mobilizing these armed forces to break the siege on eastern GThe apostate Zahr˜n ‚All˚sh, leader of ﬁJaysh al-Isl˜mﬂ72INTERVIEW˜is mobilization was very apparent in al-Qunaytirah and al-Qn the last few days, the regime made it easy for the convoys of Jaysh al-Isl˚m to exit and go towards East Q to ˛ght the Islamic State on its behalf. ˜ese coalitions were mirrored elsewhere on a large scale, in South Dimashq in general and in the Y Camp speci˛cally. ˜ere were major plans made by these factions (Jaysh al-Isl˚m, S Ab˚b˝l Hawr˚n) to besiege the Islamic State in South Dimashq. ˜ese factions plotted and started ˛ghting the Islamic State to expel it from the planned ﬁreconciliationﬂ regions because the Khil˚fah completely rejects a ﬁreconciliationﬂ and ˛ghts and arrests anyone who pursues such an endeavor. Quickly, the Islamic State discovered these wicked plots, and began to thwart them. With Allah™s help, the plot to hand over the region to the Nusayr˝ regime was defeated.D˜biq: Do any of the factions show interest in joining the Islamic State? Have some of the soldiers and brigades of the factions come to give bay™ah to the Islamic State?Yarm˚k: After crushing the Sahw˚t in al-Hajar al-Aswad region and after the great victory that Allah granted to the Islamic State, the soldiers of the factions who fought against the Islamic State found themselves at the crossroads. After this battle, the Islamic State became more powerful than before and its reality thereby became apparent to those seeking the truth, and so many soldiers of the factions rushed to participate in the Shar˝™ah seminars conducted by the Islamic State. ˜ere were hundreds of participants, and all praise is due to Allah. We witnessed many pledges of allegiance from many well-known battalions in the region who dissolved completely into the Islamic State.D˜biq: Why did the regime resort to using barrel bombs against the camp?Yarm˚k: What occurs to any place the Islamic State takes control of is that the regime carries out diˆerent kinds of airstrikes upon it. ˜ese regime airstrikes carry a number of purposes, among them, to force the local population to leave the areas controlled by the Islamic State and enter the ﬁreconciliationﬂ areas so that they thereby strengthen the Sahwah™s ˛ght against the Islamic State, and to give a message to the public that any region controlled by the Islamic State will be totally destroyed, and as a result, any attempt by the Islamic State to capture other regions will terrify the people of those regions. ˜ey also serve as a hopeless attempt by the regime to discourage the Islamic State from making any more advances. ˜is is evidence of the regime™s military bankruptcy. Every time the Islamic State advances and inˇicts severe losses on the Nusayr˝ army and militias, in revenge, the regime conducts random airstrikes on places where Muslims live.D˜biq: What™s your take on Zahr˜n ‚All˚sh™s recent trip to Turkey? Do you think that the apostates will try to carry over the ﬁStorm of Resolveﬂ to Sh˜m in defense of their Sahw˜t?Yarm˚k: Zahr˚n ‚Allush™s visit to Turkey and meeting with a number of leaders of the major factions that ˛ght in Sh˚m has its dimensions and consequences. Even the military demonstration performed by Zahr˚n™s army in al-G the occasion of the graduation for the training seminar was basically a message to the nations of the West and their puppets in the Gulf indicating that they are ready to secure the capital Dimashq. With Zahr˚n™s departure to Turkey, a number of factions in eastern Ged and joined Zahr˚n™s army. We believe that there will be great support for Zahr˚n ‚om the Gulf and the West in order for him to enter the capital, even if the matter requires a ﬁstorm of resolve,ﬂ like the one Yemen has witnessed.D˜biq: You know the importance of Dimashq towards the future of Islam, the Mal˜him, and al-Malhamah al-Kubr˜. How can the Muslim support the muj˜hid˝n in Wil˜yat Dimashq now?Yarm˚k: Our role model and noble Messenger (sallall˚hu ‚alayhi wa sallam) praised Dimashq very much, and this was mentioned in a number 73dabiqof authentic narrations. Dimashq is the camp of the Muslims during the great battle (al-Malhamah al-Kubr˚). But every Muslim who cannot come and wants to perform jih˚d and support the Islamic State can do so wherever he may be, just as he was ordered by the Khal˝fah (ha˛dhahull˚h) in his latest address. A simple supplication from our Muslim brothers practicing rib˚t is in itself support Œ a great support for us. Any advance of the Khil˚fah against the Nusayriyyah and R˚˛dah, any manifestation of unity through new bay™˚t to the Khil˚fah, and any attack against the supporters of the Sahwah Œ the crusaders and ˘l Sengthens the muj˚hid˝n in Dimashq. May Allah facilitate for the armies of the Khil˚fah to liberate Dimashq. Jaz˚kumull˚hu khayr˚.The Umaw˛ Masjid in the city of Dimashq74SPECIALﬁ˜is is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will ˚nd no safe haven.ﬂ Obama, September 2014ﬁAs they carve out an area of safe haven, this will be a launching point for attacks on America, the West, and attacks globally.ﬂ RAND Corporation, March 2015˜e pledges of allegiance that are now being announced on a seemingly monthly basis from Islamic groups around the world to the Islamic State are exactly what every muj˚hid prayed for and a nightmare scenario for the military and political leaders of the democratic world. ˜e incredible growth of the Caliphate and the fact that it is a living, breathing entity with thousands of square miles of territory has given Muslims around the Middle East, Asia, and Africa the belief and con˛dence to take up arms, pledge their loyalty, and launch operations with a unity and strength of purpose that has simply not been seen before.What started as the most explosive Islamic ﬁgroupﬂ in the modern world has rapidly evolved into the most explosive Islamic movement the modern world has ever seen.Nothing on this scale has happened this big or this quick before. Huge swathes of Pakistan, Nigeria, Libya, Yemen, and the Sinai Peninsula are all now united under the black ˇag of tawh˝d, gelled together as one by the Islamic State. Muj˚hid˝n of Afghan provinces that were the scenes of ˛erce ˛ghting for over a decade costing America trillions of dollars are now, less than six months after America ﬁwithdrewﬂ with its tail between its legs, loyal to the Caliphate.˜e muj˚hid˝n of West Africa control much of Nigeria and their attacks are intensifying, pushing back an exhausted and smashed national army that is now is in a virtual state of collapse. ˜ey declared allegiance to the Caliphate in March, and they are the same group, remember, that Obama The Perfect StormWhat started as an explosive movement in Iraq has now suddenly turned into a global phenomenon that the West and the democratic world as a whole is ill-equipped to deal with. - John Cantlie75dabiqclaimed just last year was being successfully pushed back by American intervention policy. Indeed, he claimed that the same model (cutting ˛nances, recruitment tools, and the will to ˛ght) that worked so ﬁwellﬂ in the degradation of the muj˚hid˝n there before their pledge of allegiance, would work just as well on the Islamic State.Some things just don™t work out as planned.˜e energy behind this movement is fearsome. A single lion can kill an antelope but a pride that is hungry and cunning enough can, if they work closely together, take down an African elephant. As groups of muj˚hid˝n from around the world join forces, so the strength behind the Islamic State puts them in a position to devour much larger prey.˜e West and its allies have, once again, been caught completely by surprise as they now ˛nd themselves ˛ghting not just one enemy in Iraq and Sh˚m, but now an international army of muj˚hid˝n numbering hundreds of thousands in diˆerent countries, whole continents apart. It™s taken the coalition the best part of a year to put together a campaign against the Islamic State that is only now seeing a Shia mob supported by coalition aircraft make moves against Tikrit, but that™s old news before it™s even begun. Why focus on Tikrit when the Middle East, Africa, and Asia are now on ˛re?And this movement shows no sign of abating. Indeed, this quickening, this coming together of Islamic groups sharing the same focus and purity of belief is only intensifying. And the more groups that join, the stronger the movement becomes.As the groups evolve from splintered cells each waging their own wars to a single, uni˛ed body, it becomes a force of immense power, like a snowball that rolls down a mountain getting larger until you end up with an avalanche. ˜e more out˛ts work together, so they can use each other™s skills and strengths to ˛ll in the gaps until there are very few weak points.ﬁSay one group is very good at bomb making and the other group is very good at propaganda,ﬂ says Jonah Blank from the US ﬁthink-tankﬂ RAND Corporation. ﬁIf you put the right bomb in the right place for the right propaganda eˆect, that can be far more important than either of these things on their own.ﬂﬁ˜is isn™t just propaganda,ﬂ said Gary Bernsten, a former CIA intelligence o˙cer on an interview with Fox News on 9th March. ﬁISIS has billions of dollars. ˜ey have a network of communications for reaching out to these groups. And it shows you how deadly and eˆective ISIS is. ˜ey are truly the most successful Sunni terrorist group in history because they™ve carved out a space for a nation state, and these other groups recognize that. It shows Obama™s statement that ‚this isn™t Islam™ is a false narrative. ISIS has been brilliant at selling itself to the hundreds of millions of people out there looking for a message.ﬂAnd what of Obama of late? In all honesty, I haven™t seen what the Nobel Peace prizewinner has been commenting on recently, but he can™t be having much fun. ﬁ˜is strategy of taking out terrorists RAND crusader Jonah Blank76SPECIALwho threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,ﬂ he said last September. I do not have any information on the current situation within Somalia, but Yemen is exploding, the Islamic State is already taking advantage of the chaos there, and it is clear nothing has been ﬁsuccessfully pursued.ﬂ ˜e American embassy has been closed for more than three months now, out of fear ﬁterroristsﬂ might attack it, as the country descends into further chaos. Would you like those words served with relish or pickle, president?ﬁ[Obama] cited US policy in Yemen and Somalia as a successful illustration of what™s in store for Iraq and Syria Œ a one-two punch of US air power with local ground forces. But Somalia is a failed state and Yemen is hardly a healthy one; both remain incubators of dangerous terrorism,ﬂ wrote the Washington Post in reply to the president™s statement. And that was eight months ago before large portions of the Muslim world took up arms.And as the Islamic State seizes weapons from the American and Iranian backed proxies whom its muj˚hid˝n massacre, it gets hold of tanks, rocket launchers, missile systems, and anti-aircraft systems. Acquiring aircraft would be the logical next step. It™s the plot of a political Western horror ˛lm.What™s happening now is a pooling of skills and experience that poses the greatest danger the West has seen in modern times. When you have that amount of battle-hardened muj˚hid˝n all cooperating and exchanging information for the ˛rst ﬁAnd as the Islamic State seizes weapons from the American and Iranian backed proxies whom its muj˚hid˝n massacre, it gets hold of tanks, rocket launchers, missile systems, and anti-aircraft systems.ﬂ 77dabiqtime under one ˇag, the potential for operations on a previously unseen level rises exponentially.Let me throw a hypothetical operation onto the table. ˜e Islamic State has billions of dollars in the bank, so they call on their wil˚yah in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt o˙cials in the region. ˜e weapon is then transported overland until it makes it to Libya, where the muj˚hid˝n move it south to Nigeria. Drug shipments from Columbia bound for Europe pass through West Africa, so moving other types of contraband from East to West is just as possible. ˜e nuke and accompanying muj˚hid˝n arrive on the shorelines of South America and are transported through the porous borders of Central America before arriving in Mexico and up to the border with the United States. From there it™s just a quick hop through a smuggling tunnel and hey presto, they™re mingling with another 12 million ﬁillegalﬂ aliens in America with a nuclear bomb in the trunk of their car.Perhaps such a scenario is far-fetched but it™s the sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies and it™s in˛nitely more possible today than it was just one year ago. And if not a nuke, what about a few thousand tons of ammonium nitrate explosive? ˜at™s easy enough to make. ˜e Islamic State make no secret of the fact they have every intention of attacking America on its home soil and they™re not going to mince about with two muj˚hid˝n taking down a dozen casualties if it originates from the Caliphate. ˜ey™ll be looking to do something big, something that would make any past operation look like a squirrel shoot, and the more groups that pledge allegiance the more possible it becomes to pull oˆ something truly epic.Remember, all of this has happened in less than a year. How more dangerous will be the lines of communication and supply a year on from today? If the West completely failed to spot the emergence of the Islamic State and then the allies who so quickly pledged allegiance to it from around the world, what else of massive signi˛cance are they going to miss next?Let me ˛nish with a quick example of the sheer motivation of the Muslim ˛ghters the West now ˛nds itself up against. ˜e other day I had the opportunity to meet one charismatic ˛ghter from an Arab country. Educated and intelligent, he told me with disgust that some of his blood brothers are serving soldiers in an Arab regime army. ﬁI talk to them once every few months on the telephone,ﬂ he said. ﬁ˜ey are my blood brothers, so I speak to them and advise them in hope that they might change. If they refuse, then insh˚™all˚h I will get the chance to kill them all on the battle˛eld. ˜ey egime that loves America while I ˛ght for Allah. Who is the stronger one?ﬂIt was an awe-inspiring and humbling example of how the West can never win this war. Perhaps once there was a chance that an attack inside the West or on Western borders by the Islamic State could be averted through negotiations, but no longer. As the territory of the Islamic State crosses from one border to another like a wild˛re that is burning out of control, it™ll be only a matter of time before the Islamic State reaches the Western world.Obama leadinga failed crusade‚Abdull˚h Ibn Masanh) said, ﬁ˜e Last Hour will not be established until inheritance is not divided and booty is not rejoiced over.ﬂ ˜en he said, while pointing towards Sh˚m, ﬁAn enemy will gather against the people of Islam and the people of Islam will gather against them.ﬂ He was asked, ﬁYou mean the Romans?ﬂ He replied, ﬁYes, and there will be a severe retreat. ˜e Muslims will prepare a detach-ment for ˛ghting unto death that will not return but victorious. ˜ey will ˛ght until night will intervene between them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out. ˜e Muslims will again prepare a detachment for ˛ghting unto death that will not return but victorious. ˜ey will ˛ght until night will intervene between them; both sides will return without being victorious and the de-tachment will be wiped out. ˜e Muslims will again prepare a detachment for ˛ghting unto death that will not return but victori-ous. ˜ey will ˛ght until night comes upon them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wi-ped out. On the fourth day, the remnants of the people of Islam will arise to ˛ght them and Allah will bring defeat upon their enemy. ˜ey will ˛ght such a ˛ght the like of which will not be seen (or which has not been seen), so much so that if a bird were to pass through their areas, it would fall dead before passing them. ˜ereafter, paternal relatives will count each other and ˛nd that after being one hundred, only one man is left from them. So what booty can be re-joiced over! And what inheritance can be divided! While they are in this condition, they will hear of a danger greater than this. A cry will reach them, ‚˜e Dajj˚l has taken your place among your families.™ ˜ey will then abandon what is in their hands, ad-vance, and dispatch ten horsemen as a scou-ting partyalayhi wa sallam) said, ‚I know their names, the na-mes of their fathers, and the colors of their horses. ˜ey will be the best horsemen on the face of the Earth on that day or amongst the best horsemen on the face of the Earth on that day™ﬂ [Sah˝h Muslim].

Two even bloodier strikes were carried out in Tunisia and Kuwait by wil˜y˜t of the Islamic State. In Kuwait, a R˜˚d˛ temple was rocked by an explosion set o˝ by Ab˙ Sulaym˜n al-Muwahhid, a muj˜hid who charged into the midst of the R˜˚dah and punished them in revenge for Ahlus-Sunnah and in defense of the Khil˜fah, which the government of Kuwait is waging war against as part of the crusader coalition. In Tunisia, the muj˜hid Ab˙ Yahyr˜ al-Qayraw˜n˛ made his way into a hotel beach resort in the town of Sousse with an assault riˆe and massacred dozens of citizens belonging to a number of European crusader states also involved in the coalition waging war against the Islamic State.ˇese were the latest in a line of attacks carried out over the past year by soldiers of the Khil˜fah around the world Œ including those from the wil˜y˜t of the Khil˜fah itself Œ in response to the Islamic State™s call to ˚ght the mushrik˛n wherever they™re found, especially those belonging to ForewordTwo weeks ago, on the Friday marking the 9th day of the blessed month of Ramad˜n, the Crusaders and the R˜˚dah were struck by a wave of attacks in three di˛erent regions, one of them in the crusader city of Lyon. ˝e day of the attacks would come to be known as ﬁBloody Friday,ﬂ1 a day that brought more healing to the hearts of the Muslims and the muj˜hid˙n, and ˚lled the hearts of their enemies with terror and rage.the member nations of the crusader coalition, a coalition that ˚ghts the Shar˛™ah wherever it™s established, seeking to uproot it and replace it with a nationalist democracy. Shaykh Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Adn˜n˛ (ha˚dhahull˜h) stated, ﬁO muwahhid˛n in Europe, America, Australia, and Canada– O muwahhid˛n in Morocco and Algeria– O muwahhid˛n in Khur˜s˜n, al-Qawq˜z, and Iran [the Sunn˛ Kurds and the Sunn˛ Arabs]– O muwahhid˛n everywhere upon the face of the Earth– O brothers in creed– O people of wal˜™ and bar˜™– O patrons of the Islamic State– O you who have given bay™ah to the Khal˛fah Ibr˜h˛m everywhere– O you who have loved the Islamic State– O you who support the Khil˜fah– O you who consider yourselves from amongst its soldiers and patrons–ﬂﬁYour state is facing a new campaign by the crusaders.

O muwahhid, we call you up to defend the Islamic State. Dozens of nations have gathered against it. ˇey began their war against us at all levels. So rise O muwahhid. Rise and defend your state from your place wherever you may beﬂ [Indeed Your Lord Is Ever Watchful].ˇe call to defend the Islamic State Œ the only state ruling by Allah™s Shar˛™ah today Œ continues to be answered by sincere Muslims and muj˜hid˛n around the world prepared to sacri˚ce their lives and everything dear to them to raise high the word of Allah and trample democracy and nationalism. In contrast, the jih˜d claimants in Sh˜m and other regions are prepared to sacri˚ce the principles of the religion and wage war against the Islamic State in defense of a j˜hil˛ nationalism coated with a thin veneer of ﬁShar˛™ah,ﬂ knowing full well that should they succeed in taking any territory from the Khil˜fah, that territory would no longer be ruled by Allah™s pure Shar˛™ah.To further demonstrate the disgraceful nature of these jih˜d claimants, one only needs to take note that the Muslims who set out to answer Shaykh al-‚Adn˜n˛™s call to defend the Khil˜fah often ˚nd themselves marching forward alone, with none to rely on for support in their e˝orts to defend the Shar˛™ah except Allah. ˇe jih˜d claimants, on the other hand, are relatively large groups of well-armed ˚ghters that have the ability to take and hold territory and impose their will. Yet they refuse to establish the rule of Allah despite the strength and consolidation that He has granted them.In further contrast between the sincere muwahhid˛n and the jih˜d claimants, one can see that the likes of the muwahidd˛n who terrorized the ku˝˜r on ﬁBloody Fridayﬂ and even before that, are typically vili˚ed and made out to be extremists on the fringes of society, or individuals su˝ering from poverty, unemployment, or other social issues. Yet they persist in their jih˜d, not concerning themselves with how they will subsequently be portrayed in the sorcerous media or what the people would say about them. ˇis is simply because they pursue the pleasure of Allah, not the pleasure of the people. ˇe cowardly jih˜d claimants, in comparison, with their large numbers, heavy weaponry, and  their claim of some regions of Sh˜m, are nonetheless afraid of implementing the Shar˛™ah lest they o˝end the people, therefore choosing instead to pursue the pleasure of the people over the pleasure of Allah.Allah™s Messenger  said, ﬁWhoever pleases Allah at the expense of angering the people, Allah will be su˘cient for him against the people™s harm, and whoever pleases the people at the expense of angering Allah, Allah will [abandon him and] leave his a˝air to the peopleﬂ [Reported by at-Tirmidh˛ from ‚™ishah].ˇus we renew our call to the sincere Muslims around the world to march forth and wage war against the crusaders and apostates who seek to wipe out the Shar˛™ah. March forth, neither fearing the blame of the critics, nor seeking the pleasure of the people, for the hukm belongs to Allah, not the people.{Legislation is not but for Allah} [Y˙suf: 40].The scene outside the targeted R˜˝d˛ temple in KuwaitAb˚ Sulaym˜n al-Muwahhid (may Allah accept him)Ab˚ Yahy˜ al-Qayraw˜n˛ (may Allah accept him)The crusader nation of Britainmourns its dead citizens5dabiq6ARTICLEOn Friday 2 Rab˛™ al-Awwal 1435AH (3 January 2014), the Syrian Sahwah was launched against the Islamic State after the leadership of the factions gathered to plot their conspiracy. ﬁJaysh al-Muj˜hid˛nﬂ and ﬁJabhat ˇuww˜r S˙riy˜ﬂ (of Jam˜l Ma™r˙f) made the ˚rst move and were followed systematically by the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ and the Jawl˜n˛ front. One of the biggest allies of the Jawl˜n˛ front since the beginning of the Sahwah has been the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ with Zahran Alloush as its top military commander.In Sha™b˜n, the crusaders of ﬁMcClatchyﬂ interviewed Zahran Alloush in Turkey, the favored base of the Sahwah leadership. ˇe following are excerpts from an article the interviewers wrote summarizing the interview:ﬁIslamist rebel leader walks back rhetoric in ˚rst interview with U.S. media.ﬂﬁ[I]n his ˚rst interview with U.S. news media, Alloush was the model of pragmatism.ﬂﬁGone were his previous calls to expel members of the ruling Alawite sect from Damascus. In the interview he called them ‚part of the Syrian people™ and said that only those with blood on their hands should be held accountable.ﬂﬁAbandoned, too, was the talk of an Islamic state. Now he said he favored allowing Syrians to decide what sort of state they wanted.ﬂﬁ‚We want to establish a state in which our rights are ful˚lled,™ he said, denouncing what he called the ‚sectarian discrimination™ against the Sunni Muslim majority. ‚After that, the people should choose the sort of state they want.™ He said he would favor a ‚technocratic, professional government.™ﬂﬁAsked by McClatchy to explain his change in stance, Alloush said his original statements were due to the pressure he lived under in Ghouta, the scene of a poison gas attack two years ago that killed hundreds.ﬂﬁ‚We are under siege. We all su˝er psychological stress. When I was in prison and the jailer would come and torture prisoners, after he would leave, prisoners would quarrel and beat each other,™ he said.ﬂﬁHis spokesman, Islam Alloush, said the speeches Zahran Alloush had made in Ghouta were for internal consumption, to rally ˚ghters in the face of other, far more radical Islamist forces, such as the Islamic State. ‚ˇere™s speech for the internal audience and for the external audience,™ he said. ‚ˇe internal speech is devoted to saving our sons from joining the Islamic State.™ﬂﬁHas [Zahran] changed his views? ‚ˇat is a very The murtadd Zahran Alloush calls to democracy7dabiqgood question,™ said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma who™s written about Alloush. Alloush and his sta˝ ‚are getting much more savvy,™ he said, based on Twitter conversations he™s had with the commander™s spokesman.ﬂﬁ‚Everybody is aware now that the regime is very weak and on the way to collapse,™ said Bassam Barabandi, a former Syrian diplomat who lives in Washington. ‚And every major player wants to be acceptable to the West and to the international community.™ﬂﬁ‚Zahran wants to be on the winning side,™ he said.ﬂﬁLandis said Alloush would be there. ‚He™s going to be a winner,™ he said. Alloush™s Army of Islam and other Islamist groups, the ‚hard-bitten patriotic types – will win in the end,™ he said.ﬂﬁPresenting a new face may be one reason Alloush traveled to Istanbul, where he was interviewed, and was heading next to Jordan to confer with rebel commanders who operate in southern Syria, as well as their international backers. His ˚ghters need weapons.ﬂﬁIn his interview with McClatchy, he adhered to the moderate line: ‚If we succeed in toppling the regime, we will leave it to the Syrian people to choose the form of state they want,™ he said. ‚As for coexistence with minorities, this has been the situation in Syria for hundreds of years. We are not seeking to impose our power on minorities or to practice oppression against them. On the contrary, we have criticized the regime and fought it because it was practicing sectarian discrimination against the majority during the eras it ruled Syria.™ﬂﬁAnother aide said that Alloush, to improve his image, was ready to dispense with the black and white Islamic ˆag and adopt the Syrian ˆag used by other rebel forces.ﬂﬁ[Zahran] said the Army of Islam had been in direct touch with Daniel Rubinstein, the Obama administration™s special envoy for Syria, an assertion the State Department con˚rmed.ﬂˇat ends the words of Alloush™s allies. To summarize: He believes in self-determination, a cornerstone of democracy. He believes in freedom of religion and religious coexistence, a cornerstone of secularist nationalism. And he compromises religious fundamentals, meets with Jewish leaders part of the crusade against Islam, and raises banners of secularist j˜hiliyyah for the sake of obtaining aid. And yet, Alloush has been one of the top allies of ﬁal-Q˜™idahﬂ in Syria (the Jawl˜n˛ front) Œ openly having praised both Jawl˜n˛ and al-Har˜r˛ (a major leader of the Jawl˜n˛ front) in interviews released o˘cially by his ﬁArmy of Islam.ﬂ He himself has been praised by al-Har˜r˛ via internet tweets.Again, the deviance of Alloush has been something known to these jih˜d claimants long before this recent interview and even before the o˘cial expansion of the Islamic State to Sh˜m, and yet the Jawl˜n˛ front supported the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ that Alloush led in the war against the Islamic State.1ˇis interview was followed by a declaration by the allies of the Jawl˜n˛ front condemning the Jawl˜n˛ front™s killing of more than twenty apostate Druze 1 A former member of Jawl˜n˚™s sh˛r˜ council has also informed D˜biq that when Jawl˜n˚ was ordered by Dhaw˜hir˚ to join the apostate ﬁIslamicﬂ Front, he refused to do so, saying that Dhaw˜hir˚ was unaware of the situation on the ground. When Jawl˜n˚ was pressured by the former Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m leadership to follow Dhaw˜hir˚™s order, he stipulated that Zahran Alloush be removed from the ﬁIslamicﬂ Front leadership, and yet he cooperated on numerous frontlines with the ﬁIslamicﬂ Front led by Alloush against the Islamic State since the beginning of the Sahwah?!The Jewish envoy Daniel Rubinstein,ally of Zahran Alloush8ARTICLEin the month of Sha™b˜n in the village of Qalb Lawzah. ˇis was shortly after Jawl˜n˛™s promise to not harm them during his interview with the Qatari t˜gh˙t™s channel, ﬁAlJazeera,ﬂ and this policy is in accordance with Dhaw˜hir˛™s ﬁGeneral Guidelines for Jih˜d˛ Action.ﬂ Dhaw˜hir˛ said under the section titled ﬁNecessary Guidelines,ﬂ ﬁFourthly: ˇe deviant sects like the R˜˚dah, Ism˜™˛liyyah, Q˜diy˜niyyah, and deviant S˙˚yyah, should not be fought, as long as they do not ˚ght Ahlus-Sunnah. And if they ˚ght Ahlus-Sunnah, then the response should be limited to those combatant parties from amongst them while explaining that we only defend ourselves. ˇese sects™ non-combatants, the families of these sects at home, and their places of worship, celebration, and religious gatherings should not be targeted. ˇe exposing of their falsehood and deviant creed and conduct should carry on. As for the places that fall under the control and authority of the muj˜hid˛n, then these sects should be treated with wisdom after da™wah, promoting awareness, exposing their doubts, enjoining good and forbidding evil in a manner that does not create a greater harm such as the expulsion of the muj˜hid˛n from those areas, or the revolting of the masses against them, or inciting a ˚tnah that the enemies exploit to occupy the region.ﬂ ˇis ends Dhaw˜hir˛™s words.Jawl˜n˛ said in his interview, ﬁAt this time, we do not ˚ght those who do not ˚ght us. Here there are Druze villages that did not support Bashar al-Asad and did not ˚ght. ˇey are present in the liberated areas and were not exposed to harm. ﬂ And when he was asked by the interviewer, ﬁBut you did not raid their villages, you did not destroy their homes, you did not seize their property, you did not destroy their temples, you did not do anything at all against them up until now?ﬂ He answered, ﬁNo, not at all. Not at all ... As for transgressing against them, then this has never occurred.ﬂBoth of them called to the abandonment of jih˜d against the Druze apostates.Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah  was asked about the ruling upon the Nusayriyyah and the Druze and answered, ﬁˇe Druze and the Nusayriyyah are ku˝˜r according to the agreement of the Muslims. It is not permissible to eat what they slaughter nor marry their women. Rather, they cannot be acknowledged with jizyah, for they are apostates from the religion of Islam, not Muslims, nor Jews, nor Christians. ˇey do not recognize the obligation of the ˚ve daily prayers, nor the obligation of the Ramad˜n fast, nor the obligation of hajj, nor the prohibition of what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited of dead animals, alcohol, and so on. And if they manifest the two testimonies of faith [there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger] alongside these tenets of creed, then they are ku˝˜r according to the agreement of the Muslims. – As for the The wretched Druze, an apostate sect under the protection of the Jawl˜n˛ front9dabiqDruze, then they are the followers of Hashtak˛n ad-Darz˛ who was one of the followers of al-H˜kim [the apostate ‚Ubayd˛ ruler]. Al-H˜kim sent him to the people of the valley of Taymull˜h Ibn ˇa™labah and called them to believe in the godhood of al-H˜kim. ˇey call him ‚al-B˜r˛ al-‚All˜m™ [ˇe Creator, the All-Knowing] and swear by him. ˇey are from the Ism˜™˛liyyah who claim that Muhammad Ibn Ism˜™˛l abrogated the Shar˛™ah of Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdill˜h . ˇey are worse in kufr than the extreme Sh˛™ah. ˇey claim that the world existed eternally and deny the obligations and prohibitions of Islam. ˇey are from the B˜tin˛ Qar˜mitah [those who claim the religion has secret meanings contradicting its apparent meanings] who are worse in kufr than the Jews, the Christians, and the pagan Arabs. ˇey ultimately strive to be philosophers upon the doctrine of Aristotle and his likes or the Maj˙s. ˇeir doctrine is a combination of the doctrines of the philosophers and the Maj˙s. ˇey hypocritically manifest Shiismﬂ [Majm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜]He  also said describing the Druze, ﬁˇe kufr of these people is a matter over which the Muslims do not di˝er. Rather whoever doubts their kufr is a k˜˚r like them. ˇey are not at the level of Ahlul-Kit˜b nor the mushrik˛n. Rather, they are from the most deviant ku˝˜r, and so the meat they slaughter is not hal˜l. ˇeir women can be taken as slaves and their property can be seized. ˇey are apostate heretics whose repentance cannot be accepted.2 Rather they are to be killed wherever they are found and cursed as they were described. It is not permissible to use them as guards, gatekeepers, or custodians. It is obligatory to kill their scholars and religious ˚gures so that they do not misguide others. It is prohibited to sleep at their homes, accompany them, walk with them, or follow their funeral processions if their deaths are known. It is prohibited for the Muslims™ authorities to abandon the order of Allah by not executing the hud˙d upon themﬂ [Majm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜].2 ˝e scholars di˙er whether or not the repentance of the B˜tiniyyah (which include the Druze) can be accepted by the Muslim authorities. Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah  said, ﬁIf they manifest repentance, then there is a di˙erence of opinion amongst the scholars on whether it can be accepted or not. ˝ose who accept their repentance if they abide by the Shar˚™ah of Islam allow them to keep their wealth. ˝ose who do not accept their repen-tance, do not transfer their wealth to their heirs from amongst their kin, for their wealth is transferred to Baytul-M˜lﬂ [Majm˛™ al-Fat˜w˜].He  also said describing the B˜tiniyyah (which include the Druze), ﬁIf these people are overcome, they manifest repentance because the basis of their doctrine is taqiyyah and concealment of their condition. Amongst them are those who will be known and amongst them are those who might not become known. So the best way to deal with them is to be cautious concerning their matter. ˇey should not be allowed to remain together, nor should they be allowed to carry arms, nor should they be allowed to become from the soldiers. ˇey should be forced to abide by the laws of Islam, including the ˚ve daily prayers and recitation of the Qur™˜n. ˇere should remain amongst them those who will teach them the religion of Islam and they should be left with these teachers – And whoever is from the leaders of their deviance and manifests repentance should be expelled from their places and taken to the main lands of the Muslims where these sects have no manifest presence so that either Allah  guides him or he dies upon his hypocrisy without harming the Muslimsﬂ [Majm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜].3 ˇese are the fat˜w˜ of Shaykhul-Isl˜m  explaining that the Druze cannot be considered ahl dhimmah, that they are worse than the Jews and Christians, and that if they repent and accept Islam then the Muslim authorities should be cautious of them due to their practice of taqiyyah and accordingly take precautionary measures in dealing with them. How much more so if they have not repented! In another fatw˜ in which he mentioned the extreme kufr of the B˜tiniyyah (who include the Druze and the Nusayriyyah) and their treacherous alliance with other ku˝˜r (the crusaders and the Tatars) against the Muslims, he said, ﬁˇeir harm upon the Ummah of Muhammad  is greater than the harm of the war-waging ku˝˜r like the ku˝˜r of the Tatars, the Franks [European crusaders], and others – ˇere is no doubt that jih˜d against these people and the implementation of the hud˙d upon them are from the greatest acts of obedience and obligations. 3 As for those individuals of the sect who manifest clear signs of truthfulness, sincerity, and eagerness to further practice the religion aˆer repentance from apostasy and aˆer religious education, then, wall˜hu a™lam, there is precedence for their case in the story of Tulayhah al-Asad˚ , who apostatized by claiming prophethood during the khil˜fah of as-Sidd˚q and later repented and fought in the battles of al-Q˜disiyyah and Nah˜wand against the Persians, achieving shah˜dah during the khil˜fah of al-F˜r˛q. See his biography in ﬁSiyar A™l˜m an-Nubal˜™.ﬂ10ARTICLEˇis is better than jih˜d against those who do not ˚ght the Muslims from the mushrik˛n and Ahlul-Kit˜b, for the jih˜d against these people is from the jih˜d against the apostates. As-Sidd˛q and the Companions began with the jih˜d against the apostates before the jih˜d against the ku˝˜r from Ahlul-Kit˜b. ˇe jih˜d against them preserves what has been conquered from the Muslims™ lands and so no one who intends to ˚ght against the Muslims can enter these lands. As for jih˜d against those who have not fought us from the mushrik˛n and Ahlul-Kit˜b, then it is to further manifest the religion. And preserving assets is a priority over making gains. Also, their harm on the Muslims is greater than others™ harm. Rather, their harm is like the harm of those from the mushrik˛n and Ahlul-Kit˜b who ˚ght the Muslims. Rather, their harm on the religion is greater than the harm of the combatants from the mushrik˛n and Ahlul-Kit˜b. So it is obligatory upon every Muslim to attempt to do as much as he is able of this obligation against them. It is not permissible for anyone to hide what he knows of their secrets. Rather, he must spread them and make them public so that the Muslims know the reality of their condition. It is not permissible for anyone to cooperate with them by allowing them to remain amongst the soldiers and state employees. It is not permissible for anyone to be silent about establishing what Allah and His Messenger ordered against them. It is not permissible for anyone to forbid the establishment of what Allah and His Messenger ordered against them. ˇis is from the greatest doors of commanding the good and forbidding the evil and jih˜d for the cause of Allahﬂ [Majm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜].In response to the actions of the Jawl˜n˛ front towards the Druze, a number of their allies released a combined statement in condemnation of the act. Below you can read their statement:ﬁA Statement Regarding the Painful Event that Occurred to the People of the Village of Qalb LawzahﬂﬁAllah  says in the quds˛ hadith, ‚My slaves, I have prohibited oppression for you and made it illegal amongst you, so do not commit oppression.™ It was reported by Muslim.ﬂﬁOur su˝ering nation received with great pain the news of the painful event that occurred in the liberated Idlib province towards the people of the village of Qalb Lawzah from the sons of the Druze sect for whom northern Syria testi˚es to their The Druze under the protection of the Jewish state11dabiqgood and positive role in support of the Syrian revolution and accommodating the refugee sons of their nation from all the regions of Idlib province, those who ˆed their homes under pressure from the airstrikes and crimes of the Asad˛ regime.ﬂﬁˇe factions who were pained by the event rushed to send an o˘cial delegation represented by their brothers in Harakat Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m al-Isl˜miyyah due to its presence near the location of the event. ˇe delegation will meet with the dignitaries of the village to investigate the incidents and provide the necessary security procedures to restore safety and stability.ﬂﬁWe in the military revolutionary factions share the pain and shock of our nation from what occurred.

And if it is proven that a person has done so, then he must be punished according to the ﬁshar˛™ahﬂ they follow! ˇe only matter left is whether or not handing over those involved to the ﬁneutral shar™˛ﬂ court of their allies is part of the ﬁshar˛™ahﬂ and if they do not submit to this court, have they abstained from submitting to the ﬁshar˛™ah?ﬂA month after these incidents, Labib al-Nahhas Œ head of foreign political relations for Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m Œ wrote an article for the Washington Post on ﬁ10 July 2015ﬂ titled ﬁˇe Deadly Consequences of Mislabeling Syria™s Revolutionaries.ﬂ In it he said:ﬁAs has become obvious, the Obama administration™s response to the Syrian conˆict is an abject failure – Short-term, stopgap measures informed by the Iraq and Afghanistan experiences, along with the noise generated by a media ˚xated on the Islamic State, have taken priority over achievable, long-term goals – Nowhere is this failure clearer than in the consequence of the misguided way that Syrian revolutionaries are labeled as either ‚moderate™ or ‚extremist.™ﬂﬁIn December, Secretary of State John F. Kerry stated that ‚Syrians should not have to choose between a tyrant and the terrorists.™ ˇere was, Kerry declared, a third option: ‚the moderate Syrian opposition who are ˚ghting both extremists and Assad every day.™ Unfortunately, this commendable view has broken down because the United States has de˚ned the term ‚moderate™ in such a narrow and arbitrary fashion that it excludes the bulk of the mainstream opposition.ﬂﬁˇe group to which I belong, Ahrar al-Sham, is one example. Our name means ‚Free Men of Syria.™ We consider ourselves a mainstream Sunni Islamic group that is led by Syrians and ˚ghts for Syrians. We are ˚ghting for justice for the Syrian people. Yet we have been falsely accused of having organizational links to al-Qaeda and of espousing al-Qaeda™s ideology.ﬂﬁNothing could be further from the truth. We believe that Syria needs a national unifying project that cannot be controlled or delivered by a single party or group and should not be bound to a single ideology. We believe in striking a balance that respects the legitimate aspirations of the majority as well as protects minority communities and enables them to play a real and positive role in Syria™s future. We believe in a moderate future for Syria that preserves the state and institutes reforms that bene˚t all Syrians – Syrians consider us an integral, valued element of the revolutionary landscape, yet we have been unfairly vili˚ed by the Obama administration from Day One.ﬂﬁStuck inside their own bubble, White House policymakers have allocated millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to support failed CIA e˝orts to support so-called ‚moderate™ forces in Syria. But these ‚moderate™ groups have proved to be a disappointment on nearly every count, not least of all in confronting the Islamic State. Further, the self-defeating policy of regarding the war against the Islamic State as being fundamentally di˝erent from, and in some cases diametrically opposed to, e˝orts to remove Assad from power has brought no end to either battle.ﬂﬁˇe moral case against Assad should have been enough to discount him as an option, but now the facts of war have made it clear that he is ˚nished. ˇe only remaining question is who will deliver the coup de grace: the Islamic State or the Syrian opposition. ˇat question should prompt Washington to admit that the Islamic State™s extremist ideology can be defeated only through a homegrown Sunni alternative Š with the term ‚moderate™ de˚ned not by CIA handlers but by Syrians themselves.ﬂﬁDespite a disappointing lack of genuine engagement from the international community, we remain committed to dialogue. ˇe issues that need to be discussed are how to end Assad™s reign, how to defeat the Islamic State and how to ensure that a stable and representative government in Damascus puts Syria on the path to peace, reconciliation and economic recovery while avoiding the disintegration of the state. It is not too late for the United States to change course. Kerry™s ‚third option™ exists Š but only if Washington is willing to open its eyes and see it.ﬂSo he disavows ﬁal-Qaedaﬂ and its so-called ﬁideologyﬂ and announces they are willing to cooperate openly now with the crusaders against the Islamic State after almost two years of indirect cooperation through their t˜gh˙t allies. And this faction was supposedly the most ﬁIslamicﬂ faction according to the Jawl˜n˛ front, who themselves aided them against the Islamic State despite their extreme deviance!May Allah divide the hearts of the various factions in the Sahwah Coalition until the violence amongst them becomes extremely severe. And may Allah expose the hypocrisy, duplicity, and deviance of the jih˜d claimants.13dabiq14ARTICLE{And [recall] when We took the covenant from Ban˛ Isr˜™˛l, [enjoining upon them], ﬁWorship none except Allah and be good to [your] parentsﬂ} [Al-Baqarah: 83]. {Worship Allah, and associate nothing with Him, and be good to [your] parents} [An-Nis˜™: 36]. {Say, ﬁCome, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you.

But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them.

Indeed, association [with him] is great injustice.ﬂ And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents.

Allah™s Messenger  said three times, ﬁShall I not inform you of the greatest of major sins?ﬂ ˇe Sah˜bah replied, ﬁYes, O Ras˙lull˜h.ﬂ He said, ﬁAssociating partners with Allah and wicked treatment of one™s parentsﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˛ and Muslim from Ab˙ Bakrah]. He  also said, ﬁˇe approval of the Lord is in the approval of one™s father and the anger of the Lord is in the anger of one™s fatherﬂ [Reported by at-Tirmidh˛ from ‚Abdull˜h Ibn ‚Amr].It was also reported by the T˜bi™˛ Wahb Ibn Munabbih that M˙s˜ (‚alayhis-sal˜m) asked his Lord (‚azza wa jall), ﬁO Lord, with what do you order me?ﬂ He replied, ﬁˇat you do not associate any partners with Me.ﬂ He asked, ﬁAnd with what else?ﬂ He replied, ﬁˇat you be dutiful to your mother.ﬂ He asked, ﬁAnd with what else?ﬂ He replied, ﬁˇat you be dutiful to your mother.ﬂ He asked, ﬁAnd with what else?ﬂ He replied, ﬁˇat you be dutiful to your motherﬂ [Az-Zuhd Œ Im˜m Ahmad].So how can the muwahhid ignore this obligation and commit the major sin second to shirk by treating his parents wickedly? And how can the muwahhid not thank them, speak good words to them, and accompany them with kindness? ˇis kind treatment is obligatory even if they might be sinful, and even if they order him with sin!But the muwahhid should always remember that he is obliged not to obey his parents in what entails disobedience of Allah  as ordered by these ˜y˜t and as the Prophet  said, ﬁˇere is no obedience to anyone in disobedience of Allah. Obedience is only in goodﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˛ and Muslim from ‚Al˛]. He  also said, ﬁUpon the Muslim is to listen and obey in regards to what he likes and dislikes, except if he is ordered with sin. If he is ordered with sin, then there is no listening nor obedience [in sin]ﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˛ and Muslim from Ibn ‚Umar].Amongst the major sins that many parents order their children with is the abandonment of the fard ‚ayn jih˜d (jih˜d which is obligatory upon each and every individual). ˇey intentionally or unintentionally distort the meaning of various ah˜d˛th on the obligation to obtain the permission of one™s Muslim parents before performing fard kif˜yah jih˜d (jih˜d which is an obligation on the Ummah as a whole but not obligatory upon each and every individual). ˇese ah˜d˛th should be understood in light of other evidences including the statement of Allah , {Say, ﬁIf your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jih˜d in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the de˚antly disobedient peopleﬂ} [At-Tawbah: 24]. ˇis ˜yah refers to a jih˜d that is not excused by obeying one™s parents. ˇe scholars have unanimously explained that such jih˜d is the fard ‚ayn jih˜d.Ibn Qud˜mah said, ﬁIf jih˜d becomes obligatory upon him then the permission of his parents is not taken into consideration because the jih˜d has become fard ‚ayn and abandonment of it is a sin. ˇere is no obedience to anyone in disobedience of Allah. Similarly is the case of hajj, jam˜™ah prayer, Friday prayer, travel for seeking obligatory knowledge. Al-Awz˜™˛ said, ‚ˇere is no obedience to the parents in abandonment of obligations, Friday prayer, hajj, and jih˜d, because they are acts of worship that became obligatory upon him as an 16ARTICLEindividual. So the permission of parents is not taken into consideration just like prayer and because Allah  said, {And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House Œ for whoever is able to ˚nd thermr˜n: 97]. He did not make the permission of parents a condition™ﬂ [Al-Mughn˛].Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah said, ﬁIf the enemy plans to attack the Muslims, then repelling him becomes obligatory upon all those intended for by the attack and upon those not intended for by the attack, so that they support them, just as Allah  said, {And if they seek help of you for the religion, then you must help} [Al-Anf˜l: 72] and just as the Prophet  ordered to support the Muslimsﬂ [Majm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜].ˇe scholars mentioned numerous cases that make jih˜d against the ku˝˜r fard ‚ayn, including the invasion of the Muslims™ lands, the imprisonment of Muslims, the imminent threat of attack against the Muslims, and the faceo˝ of the opposing armies. ˇe Khal˛fah (ha˚dhahull˜h) has made a call for a general mobilization, further emphasizing this obligation Œ as one of the cases making jih˜d fard ‚ayn is the Im˜m commanding all the Muslims with jih˜d Œ so how can one ignore this clear-cut obligation now and be satis˚ed with submission to his lower self? How can one claim to be a muwahhid while preferring one™s parents to Allah in love and obedience when the essence of tawh˛d is preferring Allah to everyone and everything else in love and obeying Him Œ the Creator Œ even if it entails disobedience of all of the creation.Ibn Ab˛ H˜tim  reported in his tafs˛r that ‚Amr Ibn Yaz˛d al-Khawl˜n˛ and Ibn ‚Awn from amongst the Salaf (rahimahumull˜h) Œ when asked by individuals for advice on performing jih˜d while their parents disapproved Œ would merely recite, {Say, ﬁIf your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jih˜d in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the de˚antly disobedient peopleﬂ} [At-Tawbah: 24]. ˇat was their ijtih˜d in a time when most jih˜d was fard kif˜yah. How much more applicable is their answer when the jih˜d is fard ‚ayn, as is the case today! Rather, there is no di˝erence that the one who abandons jih˜d under any pretext when it is fard ‚ayn has committed a major sin and fallen into a branch of hypocrisy.Another mistake that some muwahhid˛n commit after Allah has guided them is that they become abusive of their parents when advising them, when calling them to the truth, when enjoining good on them, and when forbidding them from evil, whereas Allah  ordered M˙s˜ and H˜r˙n (‚alayhimas-sal˜m) to advise Fir™awn with gentle words. {Go, both of you, to Fir™awn. Indeed, he has transgressed. And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear [Allah]} [T˜h˜: 43-44]. ˇese verses indicate that when one gives da™wah Œ in general Œ it should be done with gentle words– How much more so is the case when the recipients are one™s parents? And how much more so when they are Muslims!Ab˙ D˜w˙d  said he heard ﬁIm˜m Ahmad  being asked about a man whose mother performs prayer and wud˙™ poorly. He said, ‚He should tell her and teach her.™ He was told, ‚She refuses to have him teach her and says, ‚I am older than you and you want to teach me!™ So do you think he should 17dabiqboycott her or beat her for this?™ He replied, ‚No, but he should teach her and tell her.™ He then started ordering him to tell her kindlyﬂ [Mas˜™il Ab˙ D˜w˙d].Harb al-Kirm˜n˛  said he asked Ish˜q Ibn R˜hawayh , ﬁShould a man enjoin good upon his parents and forbid them from evil?ﬂ He replied, ﬁHe should admonish them kindly. And he should not do so publically.ﬂ He then reported the athar in which al-Hasan al-Basr˛  was asked by Sal˜m Ibn Misk˛n , ﬁShould I enjoin good upon my parents and forbid them from evil?ﬂ He replied, ﬁAdvise them if they accept. But if they do not respond, then be silent about themﬂ [Mas˜™il Harb].Im˜m Ahmad  also said, ﬁIf a man sees his father upon a matter he dislikes he should teach him with neither harshness nor o˝ense, nor should he speak roughly to him. Otherwise, he should leave him alone, for the father is not like a strangerd˜b ash-Shar™iyyah Œ Ibn Muˆih].Abul-‚Abb˜s Ibn Qud˜mah  listed the levels of hisbah (enjoining good and forbidding evil) as: informing the ignorant person, admonishing with kind speech, harshness and cursing (by saying ﬁO j˜hilﬂ or ﬁO foolﬂ), prevention with force in relation to the tools of the sin not the sinner himself (by pouring out the alcohol, destroying the musical instruments, etc.), and threatening to beat the sinner and actually beating him (which can only be done by those with authority over the sinner). He then said, ﬁˇe son can use from these levels of hisbah: informing [his ignorant parents that such and such is a sin], then gently admonishing and advising them, and from the fourth level of hisbah, he can break their musical instruments, pour their alcohol out, and so onﬂ [Mukhtasar Minh˜j al-Q˜sid˛n]. ﬁHe is not allowed to practice hisbah on them with curses, harshness, threats, or physical beatingsﬂ [Al-Ihy˜™].ˇis discussion clari˚es that abuse of one™s parents is not permissible when making da™wah to them or practicing hisbah on them.We ask Allah to make us from those who thank Him and thank their parents. We also ask Him to guide our parents to His straight path.18FATW˜Question: How are you my noble brother? How is your health? May Allah, keep you ˚rm on the straight path. And may He bless you with guidance, good health, and deep conviction.My noble brother, I hope you can answer a question posed to me by a prominent person from the ranks of Taliban who has come to learn about the Islamic State and wants to pledge allegiance to the Khal˛fah Ab˙ Bakr al-Baghd˜d˛ (ha˚dhahull˜h), but he needs an answer to the following question, and we have attempted to answer to the best of our ability.˝e question:  ﬁIf the am˛r (he means Mull˜ ‚Umar) is still present, then the bay™ah to the second am˛r and the second khil˜fah is not valid, because of what Muslim reported from Ab˙ Sa™˛d al-Khudr˛ , ﬁIf bay™ah is given to two khulaf˜™, then kill the second of the two.ﬂ And Am˛rul-Mu™min˛n (he means Mull˜ ‚Umar) was certainly once a leader. But now if we suppose he was killed, isn™t it a condition that it be con˚rmed with certainty, so that the people know about the appointment of a new im˜m (he means Shaykh Ab˙ Bakr al-Baghd˜d˛) and thereby they ful˚ll the duty upon them. If we suppose that the am˛r (he means Mull˜ ‚Umar) still exists, then appointing the second im˜m (he means Shaykh Ab˙ Bakr al-Baghd˜d˛) will become questionable. It is necessary to ˚nd a solution for this.ﬂMy noble brother I request you reply as soon as possible. May Allah reward you with good on behalf of Islam and jih˜d.˝e answer: All praise is due to Allah who made the universe upon a ˚rm and wise system. May peace and blessings be upon his noble messengers Œ the guides of the nations towards the clear truth. And may peace and blessings be particularly upon our noble Prophet whom Allah sent as a mercy to all creation, to make them ascend on the ladder of wisdom towards the heavens and improve their condition in this world and the Hereafter. As for what follows:You should know Œ may Allah make us and you understand the words of Allah and His Messenger Œ that the general shar™˛ im˜mah is for the person A Fatw˜ for Khur˜s˜nˇis question reached us from Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n and was presented to a noble brother to answer. We publish it here so that it can bene˚t others out there.19dabiqwho ful˚lls its conditions and quali˚cation mentioned in the texts of the Shar˛™ah and the words of the scholars. ˇe im˜m could be general to all the Muslims, and he is called the general im˜m or the khal˛fah. ˇis leader, due to his status and the nature of his im˜mah, has general inˆuence; obedience to him is obligatory upon all the Muslims. ˇis kind of im˜mah is the default by which the obligation upon the whole Ummah to appoint a khal˛fah is ful˚lled and through him, the obligation is established. ˇis is the intent of all the verses and ah˜d˛th that order and guide towards appointing an im˜m and khal˛fah, like the hadith, ﬁˇen there will be khil˜fah upon the prophetic methodology,ﬂ and the had˛th narrated by Hudhayfah  ﬁStick to the jam˜™ah of the Muslims and their im˜m,ﬂ and the hadith ﬁIf bay™ah is given to two khulaf˜™, then kill the second of the two,ﬂ and the other texts that are about the rules regarding the general im˜m or khal˛fah who deserves this description having ful˚lled the conditions and quali˚cations for it, as in the case of the khil˜fah of the four Rightly Guided Khulaf˜™, as well as al-Hasan Ibn ‚Al˛ Ibn Ab˛ T˜lib, Mu™˜wiyah Ibn Ab˛ Sufy˜n, ‚Abdull˜h Ibn az-Zubayr and the khilafah of ‚Umar Ibn ‚Abdil-‚Az˛z , and others [from the Umaw˛ and ‚Abb˜s˛ khulaf˜™].And it might be the case that the im˜m or am˛r is speci˚c to some region or land, then he would be a territorial leader whose authority does not exceed his territory, as the historians mentioned that when the khal˛fah of the time Mu™˜wiyah Ibn Yaz˛d died in 64AH, the people of Damascus appointed ad-Dahh˜k Ibn Qays as a leader to look after their a˝airs until the general im˜m is given bay™ah. ˇis kind of leadership is not allowed except in cases of necessity and when the general im˜mah is dissolved. ˇis is done to ˚ll the political and shar™˛ gap and to establish whatever is possible from the laws of the Shar˛™ah. Many scholars of shar™˛ governance have mentioned such appointments in such situations, like al-Juwayn˛ in his prized book ﬁGiy˜th al-Umam,ﬂ in which he said, ﬁˇe purpose of im˜mah is the betterment of the condition of the general public, planning the a˝airs, and protecting the frontiers.ﬂﬁˇerefore, if appointing a single im˜m whose orders are executed is possible, then there is no doubt that this is best in accordance with the requisites of governance. If this is not possible, it is not correct to leave and neglect the people whom the im˜m™s supervision does not reach, as there will be no leader to gather them nor any deterrent to prevent them from evil. So they have to appoint ministers to whom they turn for leadership. If they remain leaderless, they will perish, and this is obvious and unpreventable.ﬂIf not for the absence of the Khil˜fah before, there would not have been a shar™˛ justi˚cation for those territorial leaderships or small groups to be formed and remain. Accordingly, it is obligatory to appoint a single im˜m and khal˛fah for the Ummah who will govern the people in accordance with Allah™s religion and make them follow the laws of the Shar˛™ah. ˇis is because khil˜fah is similar to the case of water for wud˙™, which is the default, and those territorial leaderships are like tayammum, which is an alternative allowed when necessary. And when the default is available, the alternative is unaccepted. ˇerefore, when the khal˛fah is appointed, all other pledges of allegiance and leaderships outside of it become void. ˇat is why al-Juwayn˛ said after his above statement, ﬁIf the obstacles are removed and the im˜m is able to supervise those people, the leader and his subjects must obey the im˜m and submit to him in peace. ˇe im˜m should accept their excuses and govern their a˝airs. If he decides to approve the appointment of whom they had appointed, he can do so. And if he sees it best to change him, then his opinion is to be followed and they must return to his decision.ﬂIf this is understood and the di˝erence between these realities becomes obvious, the answer to the question posed becomes clear through the just and precise description of the im˜mah of Shaykh Ab˙ Bakr al-Husayn˛ al-Baghd˜d˛ and the leadership of Mull˜ ‚Umar, since one cannot decide on a matter until the whole picture is understood. Accordingly, the declarations, statements, conducts, and nature of Mull˜ ‚Umar™s leadership shows without a doubt that it 20The nationalist borders of Mull˜ ‚Umar™s so-called ﬁemirateﬂThe muj˜hid˛n of Khur˜s˜ngive bay™ah to the Khal˛fahis a nationalist, territorial leadership not ful˚lling the meaning of the general im˜mah concerning rules, responsibilities, and liabilities. If Mull˜ ‚Umar says in one of his statements, ﬁˇe Emirate of Afghanistan believes in establishing bilateral and positive relationships with the neighboring countries within the framework of mutual respect – We assure all the neighboring countries that just as the Emirate will not let anyone interfere in its a˝airs, it will not interfere in other™s a˝airsﬂ [Congratulations on the Occasion of Eid al-Adh˜ 1430AH], then this is very clear in showing that the man is not striving to establish a general shar™˛ khil˜fah whose supervision a˝ects the whole world and that attempts to rescue the Islamic world from its k˜˚r and apostate governments. Rather he intends through his movement to establish a nationalistic state within its boundaries. ˇis becomes more clear in another statement where he spoke about the future of his land and said it would be ﬁpurely Islamic and Afgh˜n˛ in natureﬂ and said it would enjoy ﬁa nationalistic shar™˛ system – and preserve the union of the lands of the nationﬂ [Congratulations on the Occasion of Eid al-Adh˜ 1433AH]. ˇis all con˚rms that this state was created to govern Afghanistan only and that it takes into consideration the international standards by not getting involved in any disputes with neighboring countries. And this contradicts the purpose of the general im˜mah, which attempts to unify the ranks of the Muslims all around the world and has concern for all their a˝airs and causes, and it directly gets involved for their betterment and recti˚cation in accordance with the prophetic methodology and announces that it does so.Never mind the fact that all these statements and declarations greatly contradict the shar™˛ principles that command to ˚ght the ku˝˜r wherever they may be found, to show animosity towards all of them, and to not incline towards them using elusive statements or those whose words carry false meanings based upon modern day political concepts. And if the religion of an individual Muslim is not upright Œ even if he only worships Allah and abandons shirk Œ until he shows animosity towards the mushrik˛n and proclaims his animosity and hatred towards them, how could it be permissible for a party with power and inˆuence to become feeble in practicing this great rite at least in its political messages?!1On the other hand, the Islamic State (may Allah honor it) in its announcement of establishing a khil˜fah and appointing a khal˛fah for the 1 Editor™s Note: ˝e reality is that these matters are more serious than Mull˜ ‚Umar™s lea-dership being territorial or non-Qurash˚, but the noble brother answered the question in accordance with the manner it was posed to him and pointed out some matters of the ﬁemirateﬂ that had reached him. For further reading see ﬁF˜dihat ash-Sh˜m wa Kasr al-As-n˜mﬂ (ﬁ˝e Sh˜m˚ Exposure and the Crushing of Idolsﬂ) by Ab˛ Maysarah ash-Sh˜m˚.FATW˜21dabiqThe muj˜hid˛n of Khur˜s˜ngive bay™ah to the Khal˛fahMuslims, its spreading of its inˆuence to vast regions of the blessed land and the core of the Islamic world, its sending of leaders and wul˜t (plural of w˜l˛) to the other lands and regions, the pledging of allegiance of many groups to it, and its proclamation of animosity towards the world order and jih˜d against it wherever such is possible, and its controlling many of the important regions, all of this and other matters are from the clearest things showing the reality of this blessed Khil˜fah and that it is in accordance with and following the purposes and approaches of the Shar˛™ah regarding the general im˜m˜h.More importantly, the contract of bay™ah to Im˜m Ibr˜h˛m al-Badr˛ as-S˜marr˜™˛ (Shaykh Ab˙ Bakr al-Baghd˜d˛ Œ ha˚dhahull˜h) was done as that for the khil˜fah and referred to him as the Khal˛fah of the Muslims, and this State calls all the people to give him bay™ah with this name and description. ˇe clearness of this matter must be considered when judging its legitimacy, because the pledge for im˜mah is from the greatest of all contracts, which stipulate knowledge of the contract, clarity regarding its reality, and the obviousness of its wording. If the contract of buying and selling is considered invalid according to many of the scholars, except with an o˝er, an acceptance, and knowledge of what is being agreed upon, how much more so in the case of khil˜fah, considering that the bay™ah is similar in its rulings to that of trade agreements. Al-Qalqashand˛ said, ﬁˇe meaning of bay™ah is a contract and promise and is very similar to trade in realityﬂ [Subh al-A™sh˜]. Ibn al-Ath˛r said describing the reason it is called bay™ah, ﬁIt is as if they all traded their sincere obedience and deepest a˝airs for what the other side has o˝eredﬂ [An-Nih˜yah]. And we know that Mull˜ Umar has not called his bay™ah that of khil˜fah, nor did he act in accordance with its requisites, rather he made it clear through his statements that his leadership is not a khil˜fah nor a general im˜mah, but instead it works only within its borders as we showed above. ˇen how can one say Mull˜ ‚Umar is a khal˛fah, when he didn™t appoint himself as such?How strange! How can the attribute of khil˜fah be looted from a person who confronted the responsibility, ful˚lled it, and bore its burdens, and be given to a person who refrained from it, turned away from it, and worked against its requisites?Likewise, we will not forget to mention that even if Mull˜ ‚Umar were to call for a bay™ah to himself in the name of khil˜fah, it would be void concerning the consensus of the scholars and based on the clear-cut shar™˛ texts that being from the Quraysh is a condition for a legitimate khil˜fah. ˇis is due to the authentic ah˜d˛th and the agreement of the Companions on the matter. And the oddness of those who strayed from this consensus such as the Khaw˜rij, Mu™tazilah, people of bid™ah, and some of the later scholars, and supported the khil˜fah of a non-Qurash˛ should not be considered. ˇe Prophet  said, ﬁˇis matter will remain amongst Quraysh, even if only two of them remainedﬂ [Al-Bukh˜r˛ and Muslim]. And the Prophet  said, ﬁˇis matter will remain in Quraysh. No one will oppose them over it but Allah will drag him upon his face into Hell, as long as they uphold the religionﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˛]. ˇe Prophet also said, ﬁˇe a™immah (plural of im˜m) are from Qurayshﬂ [Reported by an-Nas˜™˛].ˇe Prophet™s con˚ning of im˜mah to a Qurash˛ is evidence that it is not valid for a non-Qurash˛. Otherwise, there is no bene˚t in mentioning it. Numerous scholars have reported the consensus on the Qurash˛ condition for im˜mah. Al-M˜ward˛ said, ﬁˇe seventh condition is the lineage, that the im˜m be from Quraysh. ˇis is due to clear texts and consensus. ˇe opinion of Dir˜r who strayed and permitted it for all people cannot be considered, because on the day of as-Saq˛fah when the Ans˜r had given bay™ah to Sa™d Ibn ‚Ub˜dah, Abu Bakr  responded to them with the statement of the Prophet  ‚ˇe a™immah are from Quraysh.™ So they gave up holding on to the claim and turned back from the idea of making a shared leadership, as they had said before, ‚An am˛r from us and an am˛r from you.™ ˇey submitted to his narration, accepted its truth, and were pleased with his statement, ‚We are the leaders and you are the ministers.™ ˇe Prophet  22FATW˜said, ‚Give precedence to Quraysh and do not give precedence to others over them™. ˇere is no place with this accepted text for a doubt to dispute the condition. Nor is there a place for one to oppose itﬂ [Al-Ahk˜m as-Sult˜niyyah].Ibn Hazm adh-Dh˜hir˛ overemphasized this by saying that whoever permitted the im˜mah for a non-Qurash˛ has denied the had˛th of the Prophet  and disbelieved in Allah. He said, ﬁWe narrated through Muslim from ‚Abdull˜h Ibn ‚Umar that Allah™s Messenger said ‚ˇis matter will remain amongst Quraysh, even if only two of them remained,™ and through al-Bukh˜r˛ from Mu™˜wiyah who said, ‚I heard Allah™s Messenger  say, ‚ˇis matter will remain in Quraysh. No one will oppose them over it but Allah will drag him upon his face into Hell, as long as they uphold the religion.™™ I say: ˇe narration of Ibn ‚Umar is more general than the narration of Mu™˜wiyah. Both these narrations Œ although they are in the form of information Œ are authentic and certain. If one were to allow leadership to be in other than Quraysh, it would be denying the report of the Prophet . ˇis is kufr in the case of one who allows such. So it is proved that whoever claims leadership and khil˜fah from other than Quraysh, is not a khal˛fah nor an im˜m nor a person of authority. Rather, he has no authority. He, whoever supports him, and whoever approves his authority become sinners and disobedient of Allah by transgressing His limits de˚ned upon the blessed tongue of the Prophet ﬂ [Al-Muhall˜].In general, this issue Œ the condition that the im˜m is from Quraysh Œ although some contemporary scholars downplayed it, the early scholars mentioned it as a matter of creed separating Ahlus-Sunnah from sects of the people of bid™ah, as as-Sa˝˜r˛n˛  mentioned in his poetic treatise ﬁAd-Durratul Madiyyah ˚ ‚Iqdil Firqatil Mardiyyahﬂ (ˇe Bright Pearl about the Creed of the Favored Sect) in the chapter on im˜mah and the matters related to it:ﬁIts conditions are Islam, being a free person, having healthy hearing, being just and knowledgeable. In addition to being knowledgeable, he must be from Quraysh, adult and sane, and with power.ﬂBased on all this, we say: Mull˜ ‚Umar is not from Quraysh. And this is mentioned in his biography published by the Taliban emirate on their o˘cial website. And this has an e˝ect on invalidating his khil˜fah if he were to claim this position.On the other hand, the lineage of Shaykh Ab˙ Bakr al-Badri as-S˜marr˜™˛ al-Baghd˜d˛ not only goes back to Quraysh, but also to the household of the Prophet Muhammad . ˇis is famous, well known, and con˚rmed by the lineage specialists in Iraq and elsewhere. For example, the lineage specialist and author of the book ﬁ‚Ash˜™ir al-‚Ir˜qﬂ (ˇe Clans of Iraq) said, ﬁAlb˙ Badr˛ Clan: ˇeir leader [during the era of the author] was Ust˜dh Sa™˛d al-Badr˛. [He then mentions the lineage of Sa™˛d to his grandfather Badr˛ and then said] ˇeir lineage goes back to Im˜m Muhamm˜d al-Jaw˜d. ˇey live inside S˜marr˜™ﬂ [‚Ash˜™ir al-‚Ir˜q: Page 385]. Muhammad al-Jaw˜d is from the very famous Husayn˛ members of Ahlul-Bayt. He is Muhammad al-Jaw˜d Ibn ‚Al˛ ar-Rid˜ Ibn M˙s˜ al-K˜dhim Ibn Ja™far as-S˜diq Ibn Muhammad al-B˜qir Ibn ‚Al˛ Zayn al-‚bid˛n Ibn al-Husayn ash-Shah˛d Ibn ‚Al˛ Ibn Ab˛ T˜lib. He died in 220AH.In summary, this discussion should help you understand the had˛th of the Prophet , ﬁIf bay™ah is given to two khulaf˜™, then kill the second of the two,ﬂ and the had˛th, ﬁFul˚ll the pledge to the earliestﬂ [Sah˛h Muslim]. And when applying them to the present condition asked about, there is no doubt that there is only but one khal˛fah now and that is Shaykh Ab˙ Bakr Ibr˜h˛m Ibn ‚Aww˜d al-Badr˛ as-S˜marr˜™˛ al-Husayni al-Qurash˛ (ha˚dhahull˜h). He is the Im˜m of the time who ful˚lled the conditions and quali˚cations stipulated by the Shar˛™ah, whereas Mull˜ ‚Umar was at most one day a former leader of one of the Islamic lands. And if we suppose Mull˜ ‚Umar is still alive and that the late deviant statements are not his, then it is obligatory upon him and those with him to obey the Khal˛fah and accept his im˜mah and submit to him, in accordance with the command of Allah and His Messenger to unify the word and ranks and to gather upon the 23dabiqmethodology of the Prophet , his Sah˜bah, and the Salaf of this Ummah in matters of ˛m˜n and Sunnah and rulings of im˜mah and khil˜fah. It is also obligatory upon everyone who gave bay™ah to Mull˜ ‚Umar and his emirate to know that this pledge has been overtaken by a more authorized and obligatory pledge, and that is the bay™ah to the Khal˛fah of today. ˇey should know that they will not be truly exempted from the blameworthy attribute mentioned in the had˛th of the Prophet , ﬁWhoever dies without a pledge of allegiance, dies a death of j˜hiliyyahﬂ other than by ful˚lling this responsibility, by pledging allegiance to the general Im˜m. All other pledges are feeble in comparison to it, de˚cient in their rulings and purposes. And Allah alone is to be relied upon.It may be appropriate here to respond to those people who say that it is not obligatory on the muj˜hid˛n in Khur˜s˜n and other distant places to pledge allegiance to Shaykh Ab˙ Bakr al-Qurash˛ al-Baghd˜d˛ (ha˚dhahull˜h). ˇey claim that his rule and inˆuence hasn™t reached them.ˇis claim is also not correct. It is a doubt repeated by those who don™t know the S˛rah of the Prophet  in sending his delegates out. ˇey didn™t read about the khulaf˜™ of Islam and the early leaders and how they dealt with this matter. ˇis becomes clear by saying that it is su˘cient for news of the major bay™ah to reach other regions and groups. And it becomes especially obligatory upon every group that has power and inˆuence, because of the agreed upon ˚qh˛ principal, ﬁWhatever is needed to ful˚ll an obligation itself becomes an obligation.ﬂ If gathering under one im˜m is not ful˚lled except with the di˝erent other factions joining him, then entering the greater body becomes obligatory upon all those other factions. ˇat is why when Ab˙ Bakr as-Sidd˛q  was given bay™ah in the Saq˛fah of Ban˙ S˜™idah in al-Mad˛nah, that was su˘cient to make bay™ah obligatory upon the rest of the Arabian Peninsula even though his power and might hadn™t reached them yet.For this reason, when the Arabs apostatized from Islam and some distant parts of the Arabian Peninsula remained outside the reach of Ab˙ Bakr as-Sidd˛q , this was not an excuse for them to abandon obedience to him and break their pledge to him. From these examples is the story of the town of Juw˜th˜. ﬁˇere was no town ˚rm on the truth [after al-Mad˛nah] other than this town, Makkah, and T˜™if. It was the ˚rst town to hold the Friday prayer after the apostasy as reported by al-Bukh˜r˛ from Ibn ‚Abb˜s. ˇe apostates besieged them and con˚ned them, even preventing food from reaching them. So they starved severely until Allah granted them salvation. A man from amongst them named ‚Abdull˜h Ibn Hadhaf belonging to the tribe of Ban˙ Bakr Ibn Kil˜b said some poetry after su˝ering severe hunger:ﬂﬁ‚Will not a messenger deliver a message to Ab˙ Bakr and all the youth of al-Mad˛nah? Could you come to the aid of a noble people who are besieged, sitting in Juw˜th˜? ˇeir blood in every mountain pass is like the beams of the sun blinding the viewers. We have relied upon ar-Rahm˜n and found that patience comes to those relying on Him™ﬂ [Al-Bid˜yah wan-Nih˜yah].And it also well known to the one who studies the books of S˛rah, history, and the laws of im˜mah, that if someone is given the pledge of khil˜fah in any of the lands and then sends his delegates to other regions and lands, then such is su˘cient to make it obligatory upon the people of those lands to obey him and that his order is to be executed merely by the arrival of his delegates to them, even if he does not dispatch an army and soldiers with them to make the people abide by his order and force them to do so. ˇis is certainly the case in Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n by the presence of the W˜l˛ whom Am˛rul-Mu™min˛n appointed and placed in charge there.ˇe evidence for this is that when Am˛rul-Mu™min˛n ‚Al˛ Ibn Ab˛ T˜lib took charge of the Khil˜fah, he sent his delegates to other regions, and among them he sent a delegate for Sh˜m and he didn™t have control or power over them at that time. And no doubt, they fell into the sin of division and disagreement by not allowing their am˛r to take control of them and execute 24FATW˜his power over them. Allah  said, {And hold ˚rmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not mr˜n: 103].And when Yaz˛d Ibn Mu™˜wiyah died, Am˛rul-Mu™min˛n Ibn az-Zubayr took charge of leading the people and was given bay™ah in Makkah. He sent his delegates to other regions. All other regions surrendered to him except Damascus. So whoever disobeyed him and opposed him thereby became outside of the jam˜™ah and a rebel, as the scholars have con˚rmed. Ibn Qud˜mah said, ﬁ‚Abdul-Malik Ibn Marw˜n rebelled against Ibn az-Zubayr and killed him and took over the land and its peopleﬂ [Al-Mughn˛].Finally we invite the people of Khur˜s˜n to hasten to obey the command of Allah and His Messenger , to unify the word, to join the ranks, and pledge allegiance to the Khal˛fah of the Muslims, and to distance themselves from the deviant desires that turn them from this good and throw the doubts into the hearts and souls, and to not be supporters of our enemies from the crusaders and the apostates against us, by abandoning support of the Khil˜fah that Allah™s Messenger gave glad tidings of. Today we are facing the crusader world, the forces of apostasy, and their allies. And let them be warned of following the path of those before them:{When they said to a prophet of theirs, ﬁSend to us a king, and we will ˚ght for the cause of Allah.ﬂ He said, ﬁWould you perhaps refrain from ˚ghting if ˚ghting was prescribed for you?ﬂ ˇey said, ﬁAnd why should we not ˚ght for the cause of Allah when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?ﬂ But when ˚ghting was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers. And their prophet said to them, ﬁIndeed, Allah has sent to you T˜l˙t as a king.ﬂ ˇey said, ﬁHow can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?ﬂ He said, ﬁIndeed, Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing in favor and Knowingﬂ} [Al-Baqarah: 246-247].And Allah guides to the straight path.Shaykh Shah˛dull˜h Sh˜hid (Shaykh Maqb˚l), one of the ˝rst muj˜hid˛n of Khur˜s˜n to race to give bay™ah to the Khal˛fah. May Allah accept him amongst the shuhad˜.25dabiq26HISTORYIndeed, the month of Ramad˜n has a feature distinguishing it from other months. It is the month of Qur™˜n, staying up for prayer, fasting, and charity, in addition to other acts of worship done in Ramad˜n. It is a month in which the Muslims expend an e˝ort that they do not expend in other months.As for jih˜d in this month, then the welcoming of Ramad˜n by the muj˜hid˛n is greater and the heed they take is more. ˇis is because Allah  opens gates for the Muslims in Ramad˜n and upon them He sends His mercy. ˇus, it is indeed a noble month. ˇe gates of Jannah are opened and the gates of Hell are closed. ˇe devils are chained up. It is a noble month in which good deeds are multiplied and lowly desires are subdued. It is a month in which one who fasts and stands in night for prayer with ˛m˜n, hoping for reward, is forgiven for that which has preceded from his sins. If this is the case, then what do you think of one who fasts, stands in night for prayer, and wages jih˜d with his self, his wealth, and his tongue?Because of these distinguishing features, throughout history, the months of Ramad˜n were days of jih˜d and battles. In these months many Islamic expeditions, battles, and victories occurred, victories that history would never forget. We will be brief and mention a selection of them only insh˜™all˜h.27dabiq˝e Expeditions the Prophet Dispatched in Ramad˜nˇe de˚nition of a ghazwah is a battle in which the Prophet  went out with his companions and himself led the battle. A sariyyah on the other hand is one he was not present in and did not lead. ˇe total number of sar˜y˜ he dispatched was 73, 11 of which were sent out in the month of Ramad˜n. ˇese 11 are the following:1) ˇe Sariyyah of S˜hil al-Bahr: ˇis occurred in the Ramad˜n of the ˚rst year after the Hijrah. It was the ˚rst expedition dispatched in Islam. ˇe Prophet  appointed Hamzah as its leader and sent him with 30 men from the Muh˜jir˛n. ˇey went out to face a trade caravan belonging to Quraysh that had come from Sh˜m. ˇey reached S˛f Al-Bahr, an area on the coast of the Red Sea, facing the ku˝ar and preparing rows for battle. Majd˛ Ibn ‚Amr al-Juhan˛ who was an ally of both sides, came between the two sides and as a result they did not ˚ght.2) ˇe Sariyyah of ‚Umayr Ibn ‚Ad˛ al-Khitm˛: ˇis occurred in the Ramad˜n of the second year after the Hijrah. ˇe Prophet  dispatched this expedition to kill ‚Asm˜™ Bint Marw˜n, a woman who used to insult Islam and incite against the Prophet . ‚Umayr Ibn ‚Ad˛y al-Khitm˛ came to her house at night and placed his sword on her chest, applying pressure until he had carried it through to her back.3) ˇe Sariyyah of Zayd Ibn H˜rithah: In the Ramad˜n of the sixth year after the Hijrah, the Prophet dispatched an expedition for Ban˙ Faz˜rah in a region of al-Qur˜ Valley. ˇe reason was that men from Ban˙ Faz˜rah had intercepted a trade caravan belonging to the Muslims and looted it. Zayd Ibn H˜rithah left for them while heading a troop of the Prophet™s companions. ˇey reached them in the morning and surrounded them and took Umm Qirfah F˜timah Bint Rab˛™ah al-Faz˜riyyah. She was an old woman venerated and obeyed by her people. She had prepared 40 cavaliers from her sons and her son™s sons to kill the Prophet . ˇe noble companion Zayd Ibn H˜rithah killed them all including Umm Qirfah.4) ˇe Sariyyah of ‚Abdull˜h Ibn ‚At˛k: ˇis occurred in the Ramad˜n of the sixth year after the Hijrah. ˇe tribes of al-‚Aws and Khazraj used to compete in their defense of the Prophet . So when the ‚Aws killed Ka™b Ibn al-Ashraf, who used to cause the Prophet harm, the Khazraj searched for someone who was similar to him in opposition to the Messenger of Allah  . ˇey found their target in Ab˙ R˜˚™ Sal˜m Ibn Ab˛ Haq˛q an-Nadr˛. He was the one who gathered the parties on the day of the Khandaq (Trench) and prepared the Ghataf˜n tribe to ˚ght the Messenger of Allah . He would also disparage Allah™s Messenger in the various gatherings. ˇe Khazraj from the Sah˜bah sought permission from the Prophet  to kill Ab˙ R˜˚™. He gave them permission so they sent ˚ve of their members with ‚Abdullah Ibn ‚At˛k leading them. ˇe sariyyah raided the house of Ab˙ R˜˚™, killed him, and returned.5) ˇe Sariyyah of Gh˜lib al-Layth˛: In the Ramad˜n of the seventh year after the Hijrah, the Prophet sent this detachment to Ban˙ ‚Uw˜l and to Ban˙ ‚Abd Ibn ˇa™labah, two tribes from the Bedouins of Najd. ˇe men of the two tribes used to conduct raids on the outskirts of al-Mad˛nah whilst the Muslims were pre-occupied with their battles against Quraysh and the Jews. Under the leadership of Gh˜lib al-Layth˛, 130 ˚ghters from the Muslims marched towards them. ˇey attacked them at the time of Fajr and killed everyone who stood against them. ˇe remaining ˆed. ˇey seized livestock and sheep from them which they took back to al-Mad˛nah.6) ˇe Sariyyah of Ab˙ Qat˜dah as-Salam˛: ˇis occurred in the Ramad˜n of the eighth year after the Hijrah. ˇis was at the time that the Prophet  contemplated attacking Makkah. He sent Ab˙ Qat˜dah as-Salam˛ with 8 others to Batn Idam (a valley north of Makkah). ˇis was in order to trick Quraysh with regards to the true goal of the Muslims, and make them think that the Muslims were targeting that area and not Makkah. ˇe sariyyah reached the target without facing anything and so departed, joining up with the Muslim army.7) ˇe Sariyyah of Kh˜lid Ibn al-Wal˛d: ˇis 28HISTORYoccurred in the Ramad˜n of the eighth year after the Hijrah. ˇe Prophet  had destroyed all of the idols that had been in the Ka™bah at the time of the Conquest of Makkah. He sent military expeditions to destroy the idols in the neighboring areas and sent Kh˜lid Ibn al-Wal˛d with 30 cavaliers to the idol of al-‚Uzz˜ in Nakhlah (a valley between Makkah and T˜™if). ˇey reached it and destroyed it.8) ˇe Sariyyah of ‚Amr Ibn al-‚t the same time, the Prophet sent ‚Amr Ibn al-‚head of a sariyyah to the idol of Suw˜™ in the area of Ruh˜t (near Makkah). ˇey destroyed it.9) ˇe Sariyyah of Sa™d Ibn Zayd al-Ashhal˛: Similarly to preceding examples and also in the Ramad˜n of the eighth year after the Hijrah, the Prophet  sent Sa™d Ibn Zayd with 20 cavaliers to the idol of Man˜t in an area known as al-Mushallal (on the coast of the Red Sea). When they reached it, a dark, naked woman came out with her hair disheveled, shouting of woe and calamity whilst slapping her chest. Sa™d killed her and destroyed the idol.10) ˇe Sariyyah of ‚Al˛ Ibn ‚Ab˛ T˜lib: In the Ramad˜n of the tenth year after the Hijrah, the Prophet  sent ‚Al˛ to Yemen and arranged a battalion for him. He wrapped ‚Al˛™s turban for him with his own hand. ‚Al˛ departed with 300 riders. When they arrived, he sent his soldiers who returned with spoils of war seized from the ku˝˜r (money, women, children and livestock). He then met their army and called them to Islam. ˇey refused and ˚red arrows and threw stones at the Muslims. In response, ‚Al˛ lined up his companions and fought them. He killed 20 of their men. ˇe rest split up and escaped. ‚Al˛ did not pursue them and called them once again to Islam and they responded.11) ˇe Sariyyah of Jar˛r Ibn ‚Abdill˜h al-Bajal˛: In Ramad˜n of the same year, the Prophet  sent Jar˛r Ibn ‚Abdill˜h with 150 cavaliers to the idol of ˇul-Khalasah. ˇe idol was a house in the area of Tab˜lah (between Makkah and Yemen). It was known as the Ka™bah of Yemen as people used to perform hajj to it in the J˜hiliyyah. When they reached ˇul-Khalasah they burned it and destroyed it.˝e Ghazaw˜t of the Prophet in Ramad˜nˇe number of battles that the Prophet  himself led reaches 28. ˇe greatest two battles from amongst them occurred in Ramad˜n. ˇey are the Great Battle of Badr and the Conquest of Makkah.1) ˇe Battle of Badr: It occurred in the Ramad˜n of the second year after the Hijrah. Allah described it as {the day of criterion Œ the day when the two armies met} [Al-Anf˜l: 41] and described His giving victory to the Muslims through this battle and His honoring of them after their humiliation, {And already had Allah given you victory at [the battle of] Badr while you were fe‚Imr˜n: 123].In the Battle of Badr, the Muslims, under the leadership of the Messenger of Allah  departed to intercept a convoy belonging to Quraysh that was led by Ab˙ Sufy˜n. But Ab˙ Sufy˜n changed his path to the coast and called upon the people of Makkah to aid him. ˇey departed to ˚ght the Muslims, being led by Ab˙ Jahl. ˇe two armies met in Badr (a well between Makkah and al-Mad˛nah) and Allah supported the Muslims who were 317 ˚ghters against the mushrik˛n who were more than one thousand. 14 Companions were martyred in the battle (6 from the Ans˜r and 8 from the Muh˜jir˛n). 70 from the mushrik˛n were killed and 70 were taken prisoner.2) ˇe Conquest of Makkah: In the Ramad˜n of the eighth year after the Hijrah, the Prophet  moved to conquer Makkah with ten thousand warriors after Quraysh broke their covenant. Allah  granted them victory in Makkah after an easy battle in which 12 mushrik˛n were killed and 3 Companions were martyred. Ibnul-Qayyim described the Conquest of Makkah saying, ﬁIt was the greatest conquest. By it, Allah honored His religion, His Messenger, His soldiers and his trustworthy party. ˇrough it, He retrieved His land and His house Œ that He made as a guidance for the people Œ from the hands of the ku˝˜r and the mushrik˛n. It is the conquest over which the inhabitants of the Heavens rejoiced. ˇe loftiness of its honor reached the heights of the stars. ˇe people entered into the religion of Allah 29dabiqin multitudes.  And the world was illuminated with brightness and joyﬂ [Z˜d al-Ma™˜d].ˇis is Ramad˜n! ˇis is how as-Salaf as-S˜lih (the Righteous Predecessors) were in it! Jih˜d, battles, and action, as well as support and victory from Allah! What a great di˝erence there is between as-Salaf as-S˜lih and one who spends the days of Ramad˜n in sleep and artistically preparing di˝erent types of food and drink, who spends his nights in amusement and play.ˇerefore, O you who remains sitting back from jih˜d even as the muj˜hid˛n march out day after day in this blessed month to face the legions of kufr gathered to wage war against Allah™s religion, do not allow another Ramad˜n after this one to pass you by except that you have marched forth to ˚ght for Allah™s cause. And O you who continues residing in the lands of kufr under the authority of the crusaders and the taw˜gh˛t, in the shade of their manmade laws, hearing them revile Allah™s Shar˛™ah day and night in their media and describe it as backwards, oppressive, and barbaric, do not allow another Ramad˜n after this one to pass you by except that you have made hijrah from the lands of kufr to the lands of the Islamic State!30REPORT{You would think they are united, but their hearts are divided} [al-Hashr: 14].When American warplanes began bombing the region of ‚Ayn al-Isl˜m last year in support of their YPG proxies Œ the Syrian branch of the PKK1 Œ in an attempt to halt the Islamic State™s advance, PKK supporters enthusiastically welcomed America™s intervention in the region. ˇeir excitement at being backed by the ˚repower of America™s air force did not even subside when that same air force decimated ‚Ayn al-Isl˜m, turning the Kurdish city into a heap of rubble and debris. ˇe crusaders™ desperate need for a competent proxy force on the ground meant that they were prepared to spend hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more, on providing close air cover for an organization that they still consider a terrorist entity. For the PKK, it was a reason to celebrate. ˇey suddenly had their own air force, it was clear the crusaders needed them, and as far as they were concerned, nothing could ruin the moment. It was the birth of American Kurdistan.Stretching from eastern Turkey, through northern Syria and Iraq, all the way to northwestern Iran, the region commonly referred to as Kurdistan is comprised of a majority Kurdish population. Despite the legacy of the Muslim Kurds producing 1 ˝e Kurdistan Workers™ Party in Turkey Œ including their Syrian branch, the PYD (Kur-dish Democratic Union Party) along with its YPG (People™s Protection Units) militia Œ led by the t˜gh˛t Abdullah Ocalan. It is considered a terrorist organization by the US, NATO, the UK, and the European Union.legends such as Sal˜hudd˛n al-Ayy˙b˛, amongst others, the bulk of the Kurdish political and military factions today are secularist or Marxist in nature. ˇe most prominent of these rival factions are the PKK, the KDP2, and the PUK3.Driven by their opportunism, not to mention their fear of Allah™s Shar˛™ah one day ruling Kurdistan, these groups have allied with the crusaders in their war against the Islamic State, hoping to bolster their own image on the international political scene, and secure American and international support for their political goals in exchange for their largely inept role on the frontlines against the muj˜hid˛n. For their part, the crusaders believe that the PKK represents a key part of their strategy in Sh˜m, saving them the embarrassment of having to rely exclusively on the Free Syrian Army (FSA). In Sh˜m, the PKK is depicted as a force capable of taking on the muj˜hid˛n and winning. ˇe reality, however, is that the PKK are just as, if not more incompetent than the FSA. ˇey lost hundreds of villages and conceded a large stretch of territory in the ‚Ayn al-Isl˜m countryside in Wil˜yat Halab and Wil˜yat ar-Raqqah in a matter of days, with the soldiers of the Khil˜fah eventually entering and ˚ghting their way through ‚Ayn al-Isl˜m, and even capturing the bulk of the city.2 ˝e Kurdistan Democratic Party, based in Irbil and led by the murtadd Masoud Barzani3 ˝e Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, based in Sulaym˜niyyah and led by the murtadd Jalal Talabani. It is the main rival to Masoud Barzani™s KDP.The murtadd Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani31dabiqˇe next few months would see the crusaders focusing three quarters of the airstrikes in Iraq and Sh˜m on the city of ‚Ayn al-Isl˜m alone in an attempt to dislodge the muj˜hid˛n Œ all this in support of the ﬁfearsomeﬂ PKK ˚ghters. Despite the obvious incompetence of the PKK in facing the Islamic State, the crusader coalition continued to provide them with close air cover in their clashes against the muj˜hid˛n. ˇe PKK would claim that they were advancing against the Islamic State, when the reality was that they and their FSA allies would simply move into any given area after the crusaders had already bombed the Islamic State positions there, leaving the area up for grabs. ˇe PKK and their allies weren™t ˚ghting for territory, they were simply hiding and waiting it out, letting the crusaders do the work and then walking in and reaping the ﬁfruitsﬂ when it was all over. ˇese cowardly tactics are the reason that they and their FSA allies Œ Jam˜l Ma™r˙f4, As˜ ar-Raqqah5, and ‚Abdul-Jabb˜r al-‚Ak˛d˛6 Œ were recently able to advance on the towns of Sul˙k and Tall Abyad in Wil˜yat ar-Raqqah.7 4 An FSA leader and former ally of the Jawl˜n˚ front.5 ˝e former leader of the Jawl˜n˚ front in ar-Raqqah up until three months into the Sah-wah. He was disowned by the Jawl˜n˚ front because they were supposedly no longer able to make contact with him Œ not because of his kufr Œ and yet everyday they claim to make contact with Dhaw˜hir˚™s al-Q˜™idah all the way in Khur˜s˜n!6 A former leader in the so-called ﬁLiw˜™ at-Tawhid.ﬂ7 PKK advances have been coupled with ethnic cleansing carried out against Arabs and Turkmen for the sake of establishing a purely Kurdish ﬁAmerican Kurdistan.ﬂ ˝e secula-rist Kurds™ hatred of Arabs in particular leads them to hate Islam by extension and even sympathize with the Jews and their Jewish state! Despite this fact, the statement released by the Sahw˜t condemning the PKK does not make takˇr of them, nor does it denounce Yet being the incompetent proxies that they are, the PKK Œ shortly afterwards Œ found themselves ˆanked by Islamic State soldiers who in˚ltrated their territory and entered ‚Ayn al-Isl˜m once more, with further gains being made by the muj˜hid˛n thereafter in the southern and western countryside. ˇis is in addition to the Khil˜fah™s o˝ensive in Wil˜yat al-Barakah where the muj˜hid˛n advanced on the city of al-Barakah their hatred of Islam and the Shar˚™ah. Rather, it focuses exclusively on a nationalist issue, denouncing their oppression of Syrian Arabs and Turkmen, and declaring that they do not approve of dividing ﬁthe Syrian nation.ﬂFSA secularists join hands with the atheist PKK to ˝ght the Islamic StateCrusader airstrikes on ‚Ayn al-Islam turned the city into rubble32REPORTfrom two points, crushing Nusayr˛ forces and closing in on PKK territory in the city. ˇus, the Islamic State forced the PKK into a defensive posture by assaulting them in several regions across the territory stretching from Wil˜yat al-Barakah, through Wil˜yat ar-Raqqah, all the way to Wil˜yat Halab, signi˚cantly increasing the number of military fronts that the PKK have to deal with. PKK forces had already committed ﬁmilitary suicideﬂ by stretching themselves thin over vast extents of territory and attempting to cover so many frontlines while relying solely on crusader airstrikes. And with no e˝ective local recruitment taking place in the areas that they capture Œ this is even the case in regions with large Kurdish populations, as the PKK are hated by the Muslim Kurds they oppress Œ the PKK have little hope in holding onto the gains that they™ve made, let alone making further advances against the Islamic State. ˇe PKK even had to rely for recruitment upon Western foreign ˚ghters, many of whom would come only to ˆee after tasting a few days of the hardships of war.Complicating things further for the PKK is the political situation in Turkey. ˇe rise of Selahattin Demirtas, the murtadd leader of the Kurdish political party in Turkey known as the People™s Democracy Party, may appear to some as the beginning of the end for the Turkish t˜gh˙t Erdogan. Demirtas managed to secure 13% of the votes in the kufr˛ elections of Turkey, depriving the t˜gh˙t Erdogan of a majority and forcing Erdogan into a position where his political party must now form a coalition with another Turkish party in order to maintain political leverage and have a chance at securing greater political powers. ˇis, however, can play against Demirtas and the PKK as Erdogan can™t possibly ally with the more hardcore secularists of the Republican People™s Party Œ the very party once led by the t˜gh˙t Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. ˇe more likely option for Erdogan is to ally with the Nationalist Movement Party, a far-right political entity that rejects any notion of peace with the PKK and will demand that Erdogan abandons the peace process with the PKK in exchange for their allegiance.ˇe t˜gh˙t Erdogan therefore has a choice: remain politically vulnerable, or abandon the peace process thereby resuming Turkey™s war against the PKK. ˇe latter is a likely choice and the PKK murtadd˛n may soon ˚nd renewed hostilities on their front with the Turkish murtadd˛n, further weakening them against the Islamic State.8 ˇe situation for the Kurdish murtadd˛n in Iraq Œ the rivals of the PKK Œ isn™t much better. In Iraq, the Peshmerga militia Œ the armed forces of the 8 It is not surprising to see Erdogan™s party being threatened by the rise of a PKK-linked political leader, despite Erdogan™s e˙orts to make peace with the PKK. One should also not be surprised to see the t˜gh˛t Erdogan later betrayed and ousted by the PKK, the very people he sought to make peace with.The t˜gh˚t Selahattin DemirtasThe t˜gh˚t Erdogan33dabiqKDP and PUK Œ are portrayed by the crusader media as a ˚erce ground force that can fend o˝ the Islamic State, saving the crusader forces the embarrassment of having to rely exclusively on the Iraqi army. Yet, they continue to take a beating at the hands of the muj˜hid˛n. Day after day the soldiers of the Khil˜fah strike Peshmerga positions in various regions of Iraq with mortar rounds and heavy artillery, and target their vehicles with roadside bombs. Add to this that the KDP and PUK have a history of violence, mistrust, and animosity between them, largely due to their divergent political stances.Masoud Barzani™s KDP was initially founded by his father, Mustafa Barzani, and enjoyed the backing of the Kurdish tribes, while the rival PUK founded by Jalal Talabani after splitting from the KDP carried more inˆuence among Kurdish ﬁintellectuals.ﬂ ˇe two factions have historically been at each other™s throats, with their hostility culminating in a military conˆict in the mid-90s. Following an American-brokered peace treaty in 1998, the two sides shared their rule of Iraqi Kurdistan, with the KDP governing the northwestern half of the region, and the PUK governing the southeastern half.Just as members of the KDP broke o˝ to form the PUK in 1975, senior ˚gures in the PUK broke o˝ to form a new party in 2009 called the Movement for Change, and these are just three of the various Kurdish political entities in Iraq, never mind the ones in Turkey, Syria, and Iran. ˇese divisions amongst the Iraqi Kurdistan murtadd˛n, their deep-seated contempt towards one another, their history of in˚ghting, and their greed and corruption all underscore their inability to e˝ectively wage war against the Khil˜fah. Even with American air cover, their Peshmerga forces continue struggling to advance beyond the territories they moved into following the collapse and retreat of the Iraqi army last year. It comes as no wonder, then, that the British Ministry of Defense recently announced that they would be sending £600,000 worth of bandages and medical equipment to the Peshmerga. ˇere™s no end in sight for their splitting and fracturing in the political arena, and their bleeding and hemorrhaging on the battle˚eld.It should be noted here that all nationalist agendas in the Muslims™ usurped lands are ultimately doomed to fail, even those that seek to unite the members of one nation, or even one ethnicity as in the case of the Kurdish murtadd˛n. ˇis includes the agenda of ﬁIslamistﬂ nationalists, who would readily sacri˚ce their religion for the Kurdish soldiers of the Khil˜fah, the harshest of the muj˜hid˛n against the murtadd˛n amongst their people34REPORTsake of temporary political gain, in contrast with the muj˜hid˛n of the Khil˜fah who would readily cut o˝ the heads of the murtadd˛n from their own people in defense of Allah™s Shar˛™ah. An excellent example of this is the Kurdish muj˜hid˛n of the Islamic State who continue to execute PKK and Peshmerga ˚ghters as they warn their people not to stand in the trench of secular nationalism, and call on them to join the ranks of those ˚ghting to establish the rule of Allah.Shaykh Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Adn˜n˛ highlighted their tough stance against the murtadd˛n from amongst their people stating, ﬁFinally, we do not want to forget to direct a message towards our Muslim people and brothers from the Kurds in Iraq, Sh˜m, and elsewhere. Our war with the Kurds is a religious war. It is not a nationalistic war Œ we seek the refuge of Allah. We do not ˚ght Kurds because they are Kurds. Rather we ˚ght the ku˝˜r amongst them, the allies of the crusaders and Jews in their war against the Muslims. As for the Muslim Kurds, then they are our people and brothers wherever they may be. We spill our blood to save their blood. ˇe Muslim Kurds in the ranks of the Islamic State are many. ˇey are the toughest of ˚ghters against the ku˝˜r amongst their peopleﬂ [Indeed Your Lord Is Ever Watchful].With weak and largely overhyped Kurdish fronts in both Sh˜m and Iraq, the crusaders have few options left on the table. ˇeir PKK allies are not only incompetent, but are Machiavellian in nature. ˇey supported Bashar throughout the beginning years of the revolt in Sh˜m as Kurdish shabb˛hah militias working to crush any attempt to rise against him. ˇey then formed alliances and signed truces with FSA and ﬁIslamistﬂ murtadd˛n, only to later resume cooperating with the Nusayriyyah.In Iraq, meanwhile, their recognition of the Peshmerga™s inability to make and sustain battle˚eld gains Œ as well as the failure of the Safawiyy˛n in that same regard Œ led the crusaders to make a last-ditch attempt to create a local ground force ﬁstrongﬂ enough to face the muj˜hid˛n of the Khil˜fah. ˇey proposed creating a ﬁSunniﬂ force that would comprise the core of a ﬁSunniﬂ National Guard that would be placed under the authority of the Iraqi provincial governors. ˇe proposal was met with criticism from the R˜˚dah and the Kurdish factions, but has since moved forward, with the remnants of a number of ﬁjihadiﬂ factions9 as well as the pro-democracy murtadd˛n jumping on board and supporting the crusader initiative.ˇe formation of a new proxy at this stage of the game is not surprising. ˇe crusaders lost hope in their Safaw˛ proxies and began distancing themselves from their incompetence, with the American secretary of defense, Ashton Carter, recently blaming a lack of will to ˚ght on the part of the Safawiyy˛n for their defeat and disgraceful retreat from ar-Ram˜d˛. When they were last caught by surprise due to the incompetence of their Safaw˛ proxies, Mosul was liberated. It was then that they began placing their hope in the Kurdish murtadd˛n instead. Now that they™re seeing the ine˝ectiveness of their Kurdish proxies in taking territory on their own from the Islamic State, the crusaders have begun betting on a new ﬁSunn˛ﬂ Sahwah. ˇe fall of American Kurdistan is therefore inevitable, and the crusaders will soon have no choice but to either pursue a truce or place their own boots on the ground. ˇe result, either way, will see the crusader coalition Œ in America™s words Œ degraded and ultimately defeated, bi idhnill˜h.9 ˝ese factions initially fought the crusaders following their invasion of Iraq in ﬁ2003,ﬂ but then abandoned their jihad and turned their guns on the Islamic State instead. All of these factions were wiped out, by Allah™s grace, and nothing remains of them today save for a handful of their members. It is these murtadd remnants who are now walking hand-in-hand with the crusaders and waging war against Allah™s Shar˚™ah.The American defense secretary, Ashton Carter, bemoaned the R˜˝d˛ army™s lack of will to ˝ght35dabiq36REPORTEarlier this year, the ranks of the Khil˜fah were bolstered by our brothers from al-Qawq˜z (the Caucasus) as numerous muj˜hid˛n in the region declared their bay™ah to Am˛rul-Mu™min˛n.1 More and more Qawq˜z˛ muj˜hid˛n have since joined the ranks of the Khil˜fah in the region, and Œ following consultation and coordination with the Khil˜fah™s leadership Œ the Khil˜fah has now o˘cially declared the region as a new wil˜yah.ˇe declaration of Wil˜yat al-Qawq˜z came in a statement released by Shaykh Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Adn˜n˛ at the beginning of Ramad˜n, thereby delivering glad tidings to the Muslims at the start of the blessed month.

He had, throughout his jih˜d in both Ir˜q and Sh˜m, a number of di˝erent titles and held a number of di˝erent positions.A veteran of many years in the Islamic State, the brother ˚rst made hijrah to Iraq in 2003. He became acquainted with some of the legends of the Iraqi jih˜d such as Ab˙ Mus™ab az-Zarq˜w˛ and Ab˙ Hamzah al-Muh˜jir (may Allah accept them both). ˇe former, as the jih˜d progressed, made a request for the brother to come to al-Fall˙jah. It was a call to which Ab˙ ‚Umar responded, living great days in the city that stood de˚antly in the face of the American transgression on the lands of the Muslims. Time passed, many ku˝˜r were sent to Jahannam, and the brother was hit by a crusader airstrike in which all those who were with him were killed. ˇis time Allah  saved him and he emerged relatively unharmed. He was later hit by a second airstrike, resulting in his leg being severed (he later became well known for this physical attribute).ˇe brother was imprisoned twice in Iraq, the ˚rst time escaping with a fake document under the pretense that he was Iraqi and not a muh˜jir. ˇe Americans were enraged upon discovering the true identity of the man who had slipped through their inept ˚ngers. ˇe second time was in 2008 after he was sentenced to 15 years. He and a group of his muj˜hid brothers escaped during an operation by the Islamic State to liberate the T˜j˛ prison. He was subsequently sent to land of Sh˜m and was made responsible for receiving the istishh˜diyy˛n and appointed the am˛r of the Atmah gateway. He was a brave leader during the war against the sahwah treachery and was famous for his saying, ﬁAllah will never grant them victory over us. We defeated them in Iraq, and we will also defeat them in Sh˜m, by Allah™s bounty alone.ﬂAb˙ ‚Umar was known for practicing zuhd with respect to his clothes and his food, earning the love and respect of many after reaching the blessed land of Sh˜m. After relocating, he settled in Wil˜yat al-Barakah, eventually being appointed as the am˛r of the wil˜yah™s artillery. ˇis beloved brother and veteran was killed 24 hours after his brother Abuz-Zubayr ‚Al˛ al-Harz˛ was killed in Mosul. ˇe two brothers, both avid boxers, together terrorized the ku˝˜r, leaving this world in the same way as each other.He was a thorn in the sides of the disbelieving crusaders and their slaves from amongst the apostates. We ask Allah to accept him in al-Firdaws al-A™l˜.42FROM OUR SISTERSIn the Name of Allah, the Mighty, the Strong. May blessings and peace be upon the truthful and trustworthy one, and upon his family, his companions, and those who follow him in righteousness until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:Following the war in Sh˜m that exposed the hypocrites, the matter reached a point where there were only two camps with no third remaining Œ a camp of ˛m˜n with no kufr therein, and a camp of kufr with no ˛m˜n therein Œ and the ranks were sifted, di˝erentiating between a muj˜hid for the cause of Allah Œ and these, by Allah™s permission, belong to at-T˜™ifah al-Mans˙rah (the Victorious Group), which will not be harmed by those who oppose it nor by those who desert it Œ and between a ﬁmuj˜hidﬂ for the cause of many di˝erent concepts: the civil state, patriotism, nationalism, secularism, democracy, socialism, etc. ˇey are all kufr˛ goals for which Allah has not sent down any authority, and that will bring their followers nothing more than disgrace in the duny˜ and a blazing ˚re that they will enter in the Hereafter.And it is known to every impartial person with vision that those who ˚ght as proxies on behalf of the dog of the White House and his puppets as well as those who ally with the proxy factions against the Islamic State while falsely claiming that they are ˚ghting for the cause of Allah and His Shar˛™ah yet you don™t ˚nd them implementing this Shar˛™ah in any span of territory over which Allah has given them control, and their only concern is to please ﬁthe peopleﬂ even at the expense of angering Allah, as is the case with the Jawl˜n˛ front Œ it is known that all such groups are Sahw˜t (may Allah destroy them). ˇey have gathered all the scum and ˚lth upon one matter, and that is to ˚ght the Islamic State Œ may Allah support it. ˇey are right in holding enmity towards it, for it is the Islamic State whose ‚aq˛dah is pure, and whose manhaj is upright, and whose goals are clear, and whose soldiers have placed their trust in Allah and shown resolve after swearing that war will not lay down its burdens until Islam rules every land and region, and until the Muslims are honored and leadership returns to them.With the situation having reached this point, I decided to write an article o˝ering advice and ˜ey Are Not Lawful Spouses for One AnotherBy Umm Sumayyah al-Muh˚jirah43dabiqguidance to the wives of the Sahwah soldiers, in order for me {to be absolved before your Lord and perhaps they may fear Him} [Al-A™r˜f: 164].We write this for the wives of the secular-oriented Sahw˜t who have stated explicitly or implicitly their intent to rule with democracy, or according to what the people desire, or with division of powers. Allah  said, {And He shares not His legislation with anyone} [Al-Kahf: 26].We also write this for the wives of the Sahw˜t who super˚cially claim Islam and stuck out their necks for their secular-oriented brothers and supported them with their lives and with everything precious to them against the muwahidd˛n. Allah  says, {And whoever is an ally to them among you Œ then indeed, he is [one] of them} [Al-M˜™idah: 51].From amongst the most beautiful stories found in the books of history is the story of Zaynab, the daughter of the Prophet , and her husband Abul-‚bn ar-Rab˛™, who were united by love and marriage, and split apart by kufr and shirk. Abul-‚aynab, who was the daughter of his maternal aunt Khad˛jah . When the revelation descended upon the Prophet , Khad˛jah and her daughters believed in him and followed his religion, and this included Zaynab. Her husband Abul-‚ however, rejected Islam and remained upon his shirk. At that time, Islam had divided between every married couple where one of them followed other than Islam. Abul-‚wever, held his wife with him in Makkah. ˇen, Allah  willed that he would fall prisoner to the Muslims in the battle of Badr. ˇe people of Makkah sent ransoms to the Prophet . Here, the Mother of the Believers ‚™ishah Bint as-Sidd˛q will continue the story for us. She said, ﬁWhen the people of Makkah sent ransoms for their imprisoned relatives, Zaynab the daughter of Allah™s Messenger sent some wealth as a ransom for Abul-‚bn ar-Rab˛™. She sent a necklace which Khad˛jah had her wear when she sent her to Abul-‚ve in with him after marriage.ﬂ ‚™ishah said, ﬁWhen Allah™s Messenger  saw it, he felt much pity for her. He said, ‚If you would like to free her prisoner and return her wealth to her then do so.™ ˇey said, ‚Yes, O Allah™s Messenger.™ So they freed him and returned to her what was hersﬂ [Reported by Im˜m Ahmad and Ab˙ D˜w˙d].And it™s reported that the Prophet  stipulated on him that he return Zaynab when he reaches Makkah because she was no longer lawful for him as long as he remained a mushrik. Abul-‚ and Zaynab left for al-Mad˛nah, the land of Islam. Zaynab left Makkah out of love for Allah and in submission to His command, and did not put her husband and his companionship above the decree of Allah and His Messenger , because {it is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should have any choice about their a˝air. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error} [Al-Ahz˜b: 36].However, Allah wished to open Abul-‚™s heart to the truth many long years after his wife™s hijrah, so he came to the Prophet declaring his Islam, and so the Prophet returned Zaynab to him.ˇen there™s Umm Sulaym Bint Milh˜n likewise refusing to marry a k˜˚r and stipulating that he embraces Islam as her mahr (dowry). It was reported on the authority of Anas  who said, ﬁAb˙ Talhah proposed to Umm Sulaym, so she said, ‚By Allah, one such as yourself cannot be rejected, O Ab˙ Talhah, but you are a k˜˚r man and I am a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for me to marry you. So if you embrace Islam, then that will be my mahr, and I will not ask from you other than that.™ So he embraced Islam and that was her mahrﬂ [Reported by an-Nas˜™˛ and Ibn Hibb˜n].So then that is Islam. It declares it loudly, clearly, and explicitly: {ˇey are not lawful [wives] for them, nor are they lawful [husbands] for them} [Al-Mumtahanah: 10]. So there is no Islam with kufr, no tawhid with shirk, and no ˛m˜n with nif˜q. And this small Muslim home is the core of the Ummah, and the parable of these two spouses and their children is like that of a plant that 44FROM OUR SISTERSproduces its o˝shoots and strengthens them, and then they stand upon their stalks. Its appearance is beautiful and its fruit is pleasant. If, however, its soil is polluted with kufr and shirk, then how impossible, how impossible it is for the plant to stand straight and become pleasant!From amongst the wives of the Sahwah soldiers is she who doesn™t care about the condition of her husband™s ‚aq˛dah and ˛m˜n. It doesn™t matter to her if he goes to sleep as a Muslim and wakes up a k˜˚r. She sees him swimming in the oceans of apostasy and she doesn™t care. And from amongst them is she who knows of his kufr, but remains with him out of fear of his violence. And from amongst them is she who agrees with everything he does. Rather, she may even support and strengthen him.Concerning the ˚rst, I say, know O female slave of Allah that although every accountable slave will alone be held responsible on the Day of Judgment for his deeds Œ as Allah says, {And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Judgment alone} [Maryam: 95] Œ it is not permissible for you in any case to remain under the same roof with someone who has removed the noose of Islam from his neck, and the marriage contract between you and him was nulli˚ed the moment when he apostatized from the religion of Islam. So he becomes unlawful for you at that moment and will no longer be lawful for you, and he is not permitted to have from you what a man is permitted from his wife Œ for you have become a stranger to him Œ except if he is ordered to repent and returns to Islam anew. As such, any relationship you have with him is a relationship that is impermissible according to the Shar˛™ah. Rather, it amounts to zin˜ (fornication), so beware.You might say that there are many factors that prevent you from separating from him, the ˚rst being the children Œ that he will take them from you and will prevent you from seeing them, and you have no power in that regard! And you might use the argument of ˚nancial maintenance, for he is the one who spends on you and you may not have a family Œ or perhaps they too follow the banner of the Sahw˜t, and you are caught between the hammer of your husband and the anvil of your family, so how can you be saved? I say, even though I understand your emotions, your sense of motherhood, and your fear of breaking up your family, and even though I understand your fear of poverty, I do not ˚nd any excuse for you before Allah , who says, {Say, ﬁIf your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messengerﬂ} [At-Tawbah: 24]. If someone is in this condition, what is their recompense? ˇe Knowing and Acquainted answers you, {ﬁˇen wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah FSA murtadd˛n ˝ghting for the cause of democracy45dabiqdoes not guide the de˚antly disobedient peopleﬂ} [At-Tawbah: 24]. So none of your arguments will absolve you of being questioned before Allah . If, however, you fear your Lord and His anger, and abandon this apostate husband in obedience to Him, then He  will replace him with something better and will provide for you from where you do not expect. And He will return your children to you if there is good in them, just as He returned M˙s˜  to his mother, even if after some time. If, on the other hand, you make light of the issue of remaining with your k˜˚r husband who is an enemy of Allah and His Messenger and has sold his Hereafter for someone else™s duny˜, and who ˚ghts the muwahidd˛n and seeks to spread corruption in the land, then know that nothing will save you from Allah™s punishment. It was reported on the authority of Ubayy Ibn Ka™b who said, ﬁNo slave leaves o˝ something and does so for the sake of Allah, except that Allah brings him that which is better than it from where he does not expect. And no slave makes light of something or attains it in a manner that is not correct, except that Allah brings him that which is worse than it from where he does not expectﬂ [Hilyatul-Awliy˜™].Likewise is the condition of she who remains with her Sahwah husband with the argument that she™s afraid of him and fears his violence, while being aware that he is upon other than the guidance of Allah . One of the noble muh˜jir˜t who was imprisoned during the days of the Sahwah™s treachery towards the Islamic State in Halab speaks to us saying, ﬁI and my husband were stopped at a checkpoint belonging to the Jawl˜n˛ front. ˇey then handed us over to the minions of the so-called ‚Liw˜™ at-Tawhid,™ and tawhid has nothing to do with them. ˇey took my husband somewhere I didn™t know, and threw me into one of the houses they were using as a prison for their enemies. Every day, one of the women would come to us with lunch. At ˚rst, she wouldn™t speak to me at all, and I noticed that she appeared frightened and confused, so much so that she would place the food down for me and quickly leave. ˇe days went by one after another, and I began to feel her change towards me, such that she began exchanging some words with me and asking me about some issues. So she found out that I was a muh˜jirah and I found out that she was the wife of the donkey that was coming to me almost every day to rebuke me and to ‚teach™ me my religion, or so he claimed!ﬂﬁOne day, she asked me, ‚Why are they ˚ghting you people speci˚cally?™ So I took advantage of the opportunity and clari˚ed to her the reason for their deep animosity and hatred towards us, and that we desire Allah and the rule of His Shar˛™ah in this land and for that reason we were taken as enemies and were fought. I found that she was listening, and she then said, ‚I know that my husband is wrong, and I feel that Allah is not pleased with his actions. I even want to help you escape, but I™m afraid that he™ll kill me. He™s a criminal!™ﬂYes, she was afraid of him for herself because she knew he was a criminal! She knew that he was upon falsehood, but fear prevented her from saving herself in the duny˜ and the Hereafter! What kind of fear is this that might make you lose your Hereafter, even as Allah  says, {Do you fear them? But Allah has more right that you should fear Him, if you are believers} [At-Tawbah: 13]? What kind of fear is this that makes you remain with a man that has enmity towards the allies of ar-Rahm˜n, even as Allah  says as per the quds˛ had˛th, ﬁWhoever shows enmity towards an ally of mine, I have declared war against himﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˛]?And what kind of fear is this that keeps you Fighters from the Jawl˜n˛ branchof the Sahwah46FROM OUR SISTERSremaining under the same roof with a man who is not lawful for you, and whom you are not lawful for? Rather, you even give birth to his children! You give birth to the children of an apostate man who is a stranger for you! By Allah, it is obligatory for a woman to feel that the destruction of the entire world is easier on her than to remain in the guardianship of a man who is an enemy of Allah, His Messenger, and the believers.And how often I wonder to myself, is there not amongst the wives of these taw˜gh˛t and their soldiers a single woman of reason? Is there not Yint Muz˜him, the wife of Fir about whom Qur™an was revealed commending her and will continue being recited until the day Allah inherits the earth and all those upon it. {And Allah presents an example of those who believed: the wife of Fir™awn, when she said, ﬁMy Lord, build for me near You a house in Paradise and save me from Fir™awn and his deed and save me from the wrongdoing peopleﬂ} [At-Tahr˛m: 11]. And she is the same one who the Prophet mentioned, saying, ﬁMany have attained completion from amongst the men, but none from amongst the women have attained completion except for Maryam Bint ‚Iof Fir™awn. And indeed, the virtue of ‚™ishah over all women is like the virtue of thar˛d1 over all other foodﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˛ and Muslim].She is the one for whom the duny˜ lay thrust before her, but her believing soul disliked and refused it, because she yearned for that which was better and more lasting, in Paradise, whose width is equivalent to the width of the heavens and the earth, prepared for the pious! She sought neither authority nor honor in the duny˜, nor did she seek that which her husband possessed of palaces and treasures. She said, {ﬁMy Lord, build for me near You a house in Paradiseﬂ} [At-Tahr˛m: 11]. So she attained that which she desired as al-Baghaw˛ states in his tafs˛r, ﬁˇe mufassir˛n said, ‚When M˙s˜ defeated the sorcerers, the wife of Fir™awn believed in him, and when Fir™awn learned of her Islam, he tied 1 Editor™s Note: ˝ar˚d is hardened bread broken into pieces with a meat stew poured over it.her hands and feet to four posts and left her out in the sun.™ Salm˜n said, ‚ˇe wife of Fir™awn was tortured by the heat of the sun, but when they left her, the angels shaded her.™ {When she said, ﬁMy Lord, build for me near You a house in Paradiseﬂ}. So Allah revealed her house in Paradise to her such that she saw it. And in the story, it™s mentioned that Fir™awn ordered for a large boulder to be thrown on her, but when they came with the boulder she said, {ﬁMy Lord, build for me near You a house in Paradiseﬂ}. ˇen she saw her house in Paradise, which was made of white pearls, and her soul was taken, so the boulder was thrown onto a body with no soul in it, and she did not su˝er any pain. Al-Hasan and Ibn Kays˜n said, ‚Allah raised the wife of Fir™awn to Paradise, so she is there eating and drinking.™ {And save me from Fir™awn and his deed}. Muq˜til said, ‚{And his deed}, meaning: shirk.™ Ab˙ S˜lih narrated that Ibn ‚Abb˜s said, ‚{And his deed}, meaning: his intercourse.™ {And save me from the wrongdoing people}, meaning: the ku˝˜r.ﬂAs for the one who knows her husband™s condition of apostasy, and his criminality towards the slaves of Allah, and his allegiance to the ku˝˜r, and his support for them against the Muslims, and despite that she agrees with him concerning what he is upon and defends him, and even supports him at times using her wealth and opinions, then I recite to her the following story. It is the story of the two wives of al-Mukht˜r Ibn Ab˛ ‚Ubayd ath-ˇaqaf˛, one of the liars who disbelieved and claimed prophethood, after which Allah gave hold of his ˚lthy head to Mus™ab Ibn az-Zubayr . His two wives remained thereafter. Im˜m Ibn Kath˛r states concerning them, ﬁMus™ab asked Umm ˇ˜bit Bint Samurah Ibn Jundub the wife of al-Mukht˜r about him, and she said, ‚What can I say about him other than what you say about him.™ So he left her and summoned his other wife, ‚Amrah Bint an-Nu™m˜n Ibn Bash˛r, and said to her, ‚What do you say about him?™ So she said, ‚May Allah have mercy upon him. He was one of the righteous slaves of Allah.™ So he imprisoned her and wrote to his brother saying, ‚She says that he is a prophet.™ So he wrote back to him saying, ‚Take her out and kill her.™ So he took her to the city outskirts and she was struck several times until she diedﬂ [Al-Bid˜yah wan-Nih˜yah].47dabiqSo beware, O female slave of Allah. {And for all are degrees from what they have done. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do} [Al-An™˜m: 132]. {And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror]} [Ibr˜h˛m: 42].And do not think Œ may Allah guide you Œ that having a beard or wearing a Qandah˜riyyah2 is a factor that prevents tak˚r and makes your husband infallible. How many bushy beards Œ that drank from the cup of apostasy down to the last drops, and were laughed at and belittled by the palace scholars, and allied with the ku˝˜r and fought the righteous Œ were given authority in the land by Allah and then turned their backs on His Shar˛™ah, not ruling by what their Lord revealed for even a single hour. Even in the case of a woman who committed fornication, they killed her by shooting her with bullets, while saying she was accused of prostitution! ˇey fear a wound! ˇese are beards that have compromised the principles and fundamentals of their religion until they completely cast it o˝ by supporting the murtadd˛n against the Muslims, and they recently refused to emerge before the Ummah except in the ﬁfolkish Syrian garment,ﬂ in a message to their allies amongst the factions receiving conditional support, whose meaning was, ﬁWe are nationalists. Our concern is Syria, nothing else. We make peace with the Syrian Druze and wage war against the Iraqi muwahhid. So be pleased with us and don™t fear us! We will not overstep the Sykes-Picot borders drawn up for you by the crusaders, out of respect for you, and in order to avoid and prevent your anger and seek your pleasure!ﬂ3ˇey™ve deceived you, O female slave of Allah. ˇey said, ﬁWe are ˚ghting for the cause of Allah and will establish His Shar˛™ah.ﬂ How is that possible when they™ve allied with every k˜˚r and every sinner?! Amongst them are those who don™t want the Shar˛™ah to begin with, and amongst them are those who want a ﬁShar˛™ahﬂ that is codi˚ed for them by the ﬁgeneral interest.ﬂ So whatever of the 2 Editor™s Note: ˝e type of thawb worn by men in Afghanistan.3 Editor™s Note: ˝is is referring to the traitor Jawl˜n˚, who appeared in an AlJazeera in-terview. His stance on the Druze is brie˘y discussed in the article of this issue titled ﬁ˝e Allies of al-Q˜™idah in Sh˜m: Part 3.ﬂShar˛™ah agrees with their interests, they establish, and whatever of the Shar˛™ah opposes their interests, they cast behind their backs. And through these coalitions of theirs that they™ve established, they™ve become allies to one another, and there is no di˝erence today in their ranks between a bearded person and the clean-shaven person, nor between a memorizer of the Qur™an and a heretic.Indeed you, may Allah guide you, are associating with a husband who is pleased having the warplanes of the cross ˆying in his skies in order to pour the lava of death upon the Muslims, upon helpless women and children. And how badly have they been exposed by their walkie-talkies, which revealed their joy and ecstasy at seeing the crusader coalition airstrikes on the lands of the Muslims. Indeed, you are serving a husband concerned with pleasing the Arabs, or the West, or the people, not with pleasing his Lord. You tire yourself, and all your fatigue for his sake will become scattered dust!Perhaps the wife of a Sahwah soldier will be shocked by my words if she reads them and is faced with the reality of her husband, but I say to her, by Allah, I am only a compassionate adviser. {I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through Allah. Upon him I have relied, and to Him I return} [H˙d: 88]. And if you are a seeker of the truth, then search and investigate, and Allah will not forsake your deed. And know that there are two options before you, with no third. You advise your husband and make him fear Allah  and remind him of Him. If he desists and repents, then that is the grace of Allah, which He bestows upon whom He wills. If, however, he shows arrogance and his pride in his sin takes hold of him, then it™s upon you to abandon him in the duny˜ so that you may succeed in the Hereafter. And here I call on you to make hijrah to us here in the lands of the blessed Islamic State! Do you not love Allah and His Messenger? Do you not desire to live in a land over which no rule is established other than the rule of Allah ? ˇen come, make your way to d˜rul-isl˜m. And I remind you of the individual obligation on every Muslim and Muslimah to make hijrah from d˜rul-kufr to d˜rul-isl˜m.48FROM OUR SISTERSAllah  says, {Indeed, those whom the angels take [in death] while wronging themselves Œ [the angels] will say, ﬁIn what [condition] were you?ﬂ ˇey will say, ﬁWe were oppressed in the land.ﬂ ˇe angels will say, ﬁWas not the earth of Allah spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?ﬂ For those, their refuge is Hell Œ and evil it is as a destination} [An-Nis˜™: 97]. Im˜m Ibn Kath˛r says, ﬁˇe noble ˜yah is general and refers to every person who resides amongst the mushrik˛n while he is able to make hijrah and is not able to establish the religion. So he is wronging himself and committing a sin according to consensus and according to the text of this ˜yah where Allah says, {Indeed, those whom the angels take [in death] while wronging themselves}, meaning: by leaving o˝ hijrah, {[the angels] will say, ﬁIn what [condition] were you?ﬂ}, meaning: Why did you reside here and leave o˝ hijrah? {ˇey will say, ﬁWe were oppressed in the landﬂ}, meaning: We are not able to leave the land, nor travel the earth. {ˇe angels will say, ﬁWas not the earth of Allah spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?ﬂ For those, their refuge is Hell Œ and evil it is as a destination.}ﬂAnd do not wait for other women from amongst the wives of Sahwah soldiers to make hijrah before you. Rather, be a model and an example for them all, and what a great honor it would be to be the ˚rst. ˇe Salaf di˝ered as to who the ˚rst muh˜jirah was during the ˚rst hijrah. Some said the ˚rst muh˜jirah from amongst the women was Umm Salamah. Others said it was Layl˜ Bint And know, may Allah guide you, that today you are following a husband who will disassociate himself from you tomorrow. {When those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut o˝ from them are the ties [of relationship]} [Al-Baqarah: 166]. And remember that Allah alone is the Lord of those who are helpless, and the refuge of those in fear, and the aid for those who seek help, so rush to the State of honor even if you have to exchange all your duny˜ for your Hereafter.And the last of our call is praise be to Allah, the Lord of creation. And may Allah™s blessings and peace be upon our leader Muhammad, and upon all his family and companions.49dabiq50FEATUREˇe Muj˜hid Shaykh Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Adn˜n˛ ash-Sh˜m˛ Œ may Allah protect him and make him a thorn in the throats of the apostates, mun˜˚q˛n, and ﬁtheoristsﬂ Œ said, ﬁWe likewise renew our call to the soldiers of the factions in Sh˜m and Libya. We call on them to think long before embarking to ˚ght the Islamic State, which rules by that which Allah revealed. Remember, O yy ˚tnah, before embarking to ˚ght the Islamic State, that there is no place on the face of the Earth where the Shar˛™ah of Allah is implemented and the rule is entirely for Allah except for the lands of the Islamic State. Remember that if you were able to capture one hand span, one village, or one city from it, the law of Allah in that area would be replaced with the laws of men. ˇen ask yourself, ‚What is the ruling on someone who replaces or is a cause for the replacement of the law of Allah with the law of man?™ Yes, you become a k˜˚r because of that. So beware, for by ˚ghting the Islamic State you fall into kufr whether you realize it or notﬂ [O Our People Respond to the Caller of Allah].Did the Islamic State innovate a new nulli˚er of Islam as alleged by the contemporary evil scholars whose hearts Allah has wiped out and with whom the Uˇe Messenger of Allah said, ﬁIndeed Allah has guaranteed me to take care of Sh˜m and its peopleﬂ [Sah˛h: Reported by Im˜m Ahmad from Ibn Haw˜lah]. Khuraym Ibn F˜tik al-Asad˛  said, ﬁˇe people of Sh˜m are Allah™s whip on Earth. He takes retribution through them from whomever He wills and however He wills. ˇeir mun˜˚q˛n are forbidden from overpowering their believers. ˇeir hypocrites won™t die except due to anxiety, fury, or sorrowﬂ [Al-Mundhir˛ said in ﬁAt-Targh˛b wat-Tarh˛b,ﬂ ﬁAt-Tabar˛ narrated it marf˙™ and Ahmad mawq˙f and the latter is perhaps more correct. Its narrators are trustworthyﬂ].It is Allah™s blessing upon Sh˜m and its people that the Islamic State entered the blessed land of Sh˜m and caused the plot of the Syrian National 51dabiqCoalition and its councils to fail. It conquered some of the towns and villages in Sh˜m, like al-B˜b, I™z˜z, ad-D˜n˜, and others which used to be ruled by the Nusayr˛ regime and then by the resistant parties like the Free Syrian Army and its allies who resisted the Shar˛™ah and its rulings. ˇus, the Islamic State ruled those towns and villages with what Allah had sent down on His Messenger , established in them the hud˙d, commanded the good, forbade the evil, and judged between the people by the Shar˛™ah.ˇerefore, the groups of apostates, hypocrites, innovators, corruption spreaders, rebels, and partisans Œ having diverse hearts but allied to one another Œ thought, evaluated, plotted, collaborated amongst each other, and all of them participated in the concocted treachery– A few supposedly ﬁneutralﬂ groups remained outside of this coalition, like a confused lamb, neither with this side nor the other, and Allah™s help is sought.In the beginning, the wicked Sahwah Coalition in Sh˜m consisted of ﬁJaysh al-Muj˜hid˛n,ﬂ the ﬁIslamic Front,ﬂ ﬁJabhat ˇuw˜r S˙riy˜,ﬂ the Free Syrian Army, and the Jawl˜n˛ front.11 Entering into a coalition is by cooperating with it on its aim. It is not a condition that the party signs a membership paper to join the coalition. Also, some of the jih˜d claimants persist on blatantly lying, claiming that the Jawl˜n˚ front did not partake in the Sahwah. So what is then ﬁMajlis Sh˛r˜ Muj˜hid˚ ash-Sharqiyyahﬂ (Mishmish)? And what is ﬁLiw˜™ ˝uww˜r ar-Raqqahﬂ? (˝ey were the Jawl˜n˚ front™s branch in Wil˜yat ar-Raqqah until the 16th of Jum˜d˜ akhirah 1435, more than three months aˆer the beginning of the Sahwah. ˝ey are the soldiers of the Syrian called ﬁAb˛ Sa™d al-Hadram˚.ﬂ Now they are ˇghting in ‚Ayn al-Isl˜m and Tall Abyad in one rank together with the Kurdish atheists while shielded by American air cover.)After that, Allah blessed Sh˜m and its people by repelling and reversing the Sahwah Coalition™s plot and by granting the Islamic State authority in the blessed land of Sh˜m and strengthening its religion Œ the religion of the cheerful warrior  Œ in ar-Raqqah, al-Barakah, al-Khayr, Halab, Hims, and elsewhere. ˇen the conquests expanded in the east, thus ‚Ir˜q was liberated in Mosul, al-Anbar, al-Fall˙jah, Sal˜hudd˛n, Kark˙k and elsewhere. And its soldiers continue to hope for Allah™s further support and the conquest of Constantinople and Rome.ˇe Islamic State did not conquer a city or village after this malicious plot except that it ruled it by the Shar˛™ah of Allah. When the parties of deviance in ar-Raqqah consisting of ﬁAhr˜r ash-Sh˜mﬂ and the Jawl˜n˛ front (or what is now known now as ﬁLiw˜™ ˇuww˜r ar-Raqqaﬂ) plotted against the muh˜jir˛n and ans˜r in it and acted treacherously against them, the muwahhid muj˜hid˛n expelled them from it, humiliated. ˇen they spread the authority of the Shar˛™ah over the complete wil˜yah. ˇey enforced prayer, collected zakah, and founded the Hisbah to command good and forbid evil. ˇey executed the hud˙d, judged in their courts by what Allah revealed, returned the rights of the oppressed, fought the ku˝˜r and apostates, and enforced the jizyah upon Ahlul-Kit˜b. ˇus, ar-Raqqah witnessed what it had not witnessed before from the rulings of the Shar˛™ah. Likewise was the case of the other cities and Indeed all the people of Halab know the role that the Jawl˜n˚ front played in the Sahwah Coalition, since the interrogators in the Sahw˜t™s prisons were security os from the Jawl˜n˚ front. And if a muh˜jir wanted safety, the Sahwah Coalition used to order him to surrender himself to the Jawl˜n˚ front. And this was all done in cooperation with other factions from the Sahwah Coalition as ﬁ‚Amr al-Halab˚ﬂ mentioned in the ˇrst days of the Sahwah on the Jawl˜n˚ front™s favorite TV channel: AlJazeera–One of the former members of Jawl˜n˚™s ﬁsh˛r˜ﬂ council who returned to the Islamic State™s ranks informed us that Jawl˜n˚ informed them in a gathering two weeks before the laun-ching of the Sahwah plot, that the parties had agreed upon waging war against the Islamic State soon and that he had attended the gathering in which the decision was made. When he asked Jawl˜n˚ about his front™s role in that, Jawl˜n˚ mentioned that he had pledged to cover the frontlines with the regime that would be weakened by this plot. (For details, read the interview with the brother in this issue of D˜biq.)So the wicked one knew with certainty what was concocted against the Islamic State and he promised to protect the backs of the factions, allowing them to launch their war against the Islamic State. He thereby made sure that the Jawl˜n˚ front would stay far from the foreground and thus present itself as neutral ﬁonlyﬂ defending the frontlines against the Nusayr˚ re-gime, frontlines which the Islamic State was occupied from protecting aˆer the factions stabbed it in the back. Even the image of neutrality, he quickly cast it o˙ and entered as a major player in the wicked Sahwah plot, as his front fought the Islamic State directly or by betraying its soldiers, luring them to imprisonment, and stripping them of their arms.The Shar˛™ah court in ad-D˜n˜ after being assaulted by the treacherous Sahw˜twho™ve tied the establishment of the Shar˛™ah to the agreement of the party™s leader or the consultation with and satisfaction of the local people regarding the one who will establish the Shar˛™ah. Some of them are those who reject the Shar˛™ah or most of it like the secularists, modernists, and the Ikhw˜n. Amongst them are those who belittle it. ˇey refer to the collection of zak˜h and jizyah as ﬁtaxes,ﬂ the enslavement of mushrik women and taking them as concubines as ﬁfornication,ﬂ the implementation of the hud˙d as ﬁfoolishness,ﬂ the manifestation of enmity towards the taw˜gh˛t and mushrik˛n as ﬁinsanity,ﬂ and the execution of the hadd upon the apostate as a ﬁcrime.ﬂ Some of them say that the ﬁliberated areasﬂ are d˜r harb and that it is not allowed to establish the Shar˛™ah there until war has ended. Accordingly, they have testi˚ed against themselves and spared us the need to clarify their status–Ibn Qud˜mah said, ﬁWhen the people of a land apostatize and their laws are executed, their land becomes d˜r harbﬂ [Al-Mughn˛]. Al-Mard˜w˛ said, ﬁD˜r al-Harb is where the laws of kufr have the upper handﬂ [Al-Ins˜f]. ˇus, they went astray when they distorted the meaning of d˜r al-harb to match their partisan interests. In fact, they resisted that very obligation Œ ruling by the Shar˛™ah Œ which by them not establishing it their territory truly became d˜r harb not d˜r Isl˜m! Indeed, the obligation is to establish the hud˙d in the frontier posts in addition to the ﬁliberated areasﬂ! Ibn Qud˜mah said, ﬁˇe hud˙d are to be established in the frontier posts because they are a part of the lands of Islam and we do not know of 52FEATUREvillages of the Islamic State, may Allah increase its glory and humiliate its enemies.Yes, no doubt that the Islamic State conquered some of the areas, which used to be ruled by other than what Allah revealed, areas which were ruled by the laws of the k˜˚r Baath Party, then by the laws of the factions and by their corrupt doubts and false claims. ˇen these areas were subjected to the authority of the Shar˛™ah and the enemy con˚rmed so even before the friend. ˇe Islamic State was even accused of ﬁrushingﬂ the enforcement of the Shar˛™ah laws, ﬁburning the stages,ﬂ ﬁdisregarding the bene˚ts and harms,ﬂ and ﬁnot caring about gradual implementation.ﬂˇere is also no doubt the lands ruled by the Sahwah Coalition now are not ruled by what Allah revealed and the ﬁbestﬂ of these lands is where there are committees that they™ve dubbed ﬁshar˛™ah committeesﬂ to give an illusion of Shar˛™ah while they are in r and which do not rule by the Shar˛™ah except for a few laws codi˚ed by their laws, like the ﬁUni˚ed Arabic Law,ﬂ which is called to by some of the factions, or laws which do not irritate the coalition partners nor the ﬁcommon people,ﬂ as is the case with the committees that do not establish the hadd upon the individual apostates such as those who mock Allah or His Messenger or those who abandon prayer. ˇey do not establish the hadd upon the transgressing sinner like the thief or the fornicator and they substitute the shar™˛ hadd with ta™z˛r (a censure for sins that do not have a speci˚ed hadd). ˇeir authority is almost limited to a˝airs of reconciliation between the people and even in this domain the strong have the upper hand over the weak.Every party has its suspicions and claims. Some of them say that the establishment of the Shar˛™ah incites the enemy against the people of Sh˜m and y adversities. Others say the greater good dictates not to establish Shar˛™ah and that the harm in its establishment is greater than the bene˚t in establishing it! Yet others falsely call to ignorant politics under the pretext of ﬁsiy˜sah shar™iyyah.ﬂ And from them are those ﬁFaylaq ash-Sh˜m,ﬂ allies of the Jawl˜n˛ front, raise the secularist ˙ag in Idlib53dabiqany di˝erence of opinion on this. ˇere is a need to prevent its people from committing sin similar to the need to prevent others. ‚Umar wrote a letter to Ab˙ ‚Ubaydah in Sh˜m ordering him to whip whoever drank alcohol with 80 lashes and it was from the frontier postsﬂ [Al-Mughn˛].After the cleansing of the wil˜y˜t of ar-Raqqah, al-Khayr, and al-Barakah from the Sahwah Coalition, the Islamic State did not proceed towards the lands where the Sahwah was ruling, because at that time the army of the Islamic State was already deeply engaged in a war against the R˜˚dah, the Nusayriyyah, and the Atheists in Iraq and Sh˜m. ˇus, it didn™t tread towards them except after the Sahw˜t had mobilized their various factions to ˚ght the Islamic State while expecting it to be weak as it was ˚ghting the Crusaders and their allies. It didn™t tread towards them except after the taw˜gh˛t pronounced with their own tongues and informed through the undertones of their speech about their plot to cover the lands of Sh˜m with their ﬁstormsﬂ of illusion so as to ˚ght the Islamic State and strengthen the Sahwah Coalition. ˇey announced their support for ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ (ﬁthe Army of Conquestﬂ). (Jawl˜n˛ bore witness in his interview to the conditional support of the taw˜gh˛t to his allies in ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ and this is the matter that his ally ﬁFaylaq ash-Sh˜mﬂ made clear in their statement of support for the t˜gh˙t al˙l.)And after the beginning of the war in the northern countryside of Wil˜yat Halab between the Islamic State and the Sahwah Coalition, many fat˜w˜ were published by the ﬁtheoristﬂ deceivers who sat back from jih˜d with the women, and by the extremists from the partisan murji™ah, and by their brothers from the ﬁscholarsﬂ of the taw˜gh˛t. ˇey disputed the Islamic State, declared it to be innovators, and alleged that its soldiers and commanders were Khaw˜rij who went out against the Muslim masses with the sword. But the Islamic State did nothing but ˚ght the Sahwah Coalition, which plotted for the destruction of the Khil˜fah project and even resisted implementation of the Shar˛™ah. As for the oppressed Muslim masses, then it is distant from ever intentionally killing a single Muslim!Since the matter requires clari˚cation, as it is necessary that the muwahhid muj˜hid knows whom he ˚ghts and why and likewise it is important that the enemy knows why he is fought and killed, so that perhaps some of the ignorant misguided ones in their ranks wake up and repent from what they are upon, thus it became necessary to clarify the status of the Sahwah Coalition according to the methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jam˜™ah, as is adhered to by the leaders of the Islamic State.Now we return to what the o˘cial speaker of the Islamic State said in his last speech ﬁO Our People Respond to the Caller of Allah,ﬂ ﬁRemember, O you by ˚tnah, before embarking to ˚ght the Islamic State, that there is no place on the face of the Earth where the Shar˛™ah of Allah is implemented and the rule is entirely for Allah except for the lands of the Islamic State. Remember that if you were able to capture one hand span, one village, or one city from it, the law of Allah in that area would be replaced with the laws of men. ˇen ask yourself, ‚What is the ruling on someone who replaces or is a cause for the replacement of the law of Allah with the law of man?™ Yes, you become a k˜˚r because of that. So beware, for by ˚ghting the Islamic State you fall into kufr whether you realize it or not.ﬂˇe Shaykh (ha˚dhahull˜h) explains that the replacement of Allah™s law in some area of the world with the laws of men or causing that Œ by supporting those who ˚ght against the Islamic State ruling by the Shar˛™ah Œ is kufr that expels A nationalist statement read in the name of ﬁFaylaq ash-Sh˜mﬂ and other allies of the Jawl˜n˛ front who recently ﬁliberatedﬂ Idlib54FEATUREits perpetrator from the religion and this ruling is from that in which no Muslim should have any doubt. So the Sahwah Coalition Œ disregarding their di˝erent banners, aims, and the pretexts of the participants in it Œ is actually ˚ghting a state that rules by the Shar˛™ah and enforces adherence to its laws while the Sahwah Coalition replaces the Shar˛™ah of Allah Œ which this state has established in its areas of authority Œ with the laws of men. ˇe super˚cial claim of belonging to Islam and the alleged intention to establish the Shar˛™ah (as is the case with the Jawl˜n˛ front and others in that coalition) does not a˝ect this ruling. Despite their claim that they will rule by the Shar˛™ah in the future after the end of the war and after achieving complete liberation, the reality which they bear witness to with their own clear deeds and statements contradicts this. Despite the authority they have on their areas, they do not rule them by most laws of the Shar˛™ah now (such as enforcing the repentance of apostates, establishing the hud˙d, enforcing jizyah, collecting zak˜h, establishing hisbah, and so on). If they ﬁapplyﬂ it, then they do so only in a partial way and upon the weak people not the strong ones. Furthermore, the upper hand in the Sahwah Coalition is not for these Shar˛™ah claimants, and so by allying with these resistant parties and ˚ghting with them against the Islamic State they are actually waging war against the established Shar˛™ah replacing it with something else and this is kufr and apostasy!If there existed a party which governed by the Shar˛™ah and its laws, outside of the Sahwah Coalition, isolated from it, disavowing it, holding enmity towards it, not cooperating with it, nor ˚ghting in defense of it, nor entrenched in its trenches, nor guarding its frontlines, nor taking them as allies against the Muslims, and instead it fought the Islamic State claiming that the latter is an oppressive state, then this party would have the ruling of parties similar to it of Muslim rebels. But this is a hypothetical situation that is not found in Sh˜m.ˇis ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ which was recently formed and which is supported by the taw˜gh˛t of Qatar, Tural˙l and that recently conquered some areas of Wil˜yat Idlib, does it rule it by the Shar˛™ah? Or is it that they have not ceased to resist many shar™˛ laws like the enforcement of jizyah, the establishment of the hud˙d, and the execution of the Druze if they don™t repent from their apostasy? Furthermore, what is the ruling Collecting and safeguarding the zak˜h paid by the Muslims in preparation for its distribution to those eligibleGiving zak˜h to those eligible to receive itSmashing the idols and statues of ancient nations and erasing their legacy of shirk55dabiqof one who raises the ˆags of j˜hiliyyah in their land? What is the ruling on individuals from the secularist, ﬁrevolutionaryﬂ opposition? Are they killed if they do not repent from apostasy? Or is it that the interest of the ﬁrevolutionﬂ and the ﬁrevolutionariesﬂ precedes the interest of tawh˛d and jih˜d? ˇus, the secularist is not killed and instead only the ﬁKh˜rij˛ﬂ is killed? Such is the situation in the villages of Wil˜yat Idlib, which were taken over by the Jawl˜n˛ front after their ˚ght against the apostates of ﬁHarakat Hazmﬂ and ﬁJabhat ˇuww˜r S˙riy˜.ﬂˇe reality of the two wil˜y˜t Idlib and Halab (the areas there controlled by the Sahwah Coalition) is that they are jungles of savagery ruled by the laws of the factions. Every faction has its committee and some of these committees according to them are ﬁshar™˛,ﬂ despite the manifestation of ˚tnah therein. Even if they were to judge some matters by the ﬁShar˛™ah,ﬂ many obvious and de˚nite laws nevertheless continue to remain outside of their ﬁShar˛™ah.ﬂ ˇis is from the matters which have become common knowledge and that lately made the Crusaders praise the pragmatism Œ as they claim Œ of these committees and factions.2Even if some of them gather in a ﬁshar™˛ committee,ﬂ 2 Pragmatism is supposedly a combination of ﬁrealismﬂ and ﬁMachiavellianism.ﬂ It is as if, according to them, the ends justify the means and so they abandon some laws of the Shar˚™ah because they claim that abiding by them and enforcing them is unrealistic!they divide the authority in it amongst the judges from Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m, ﬁJaysh al-Isl˜m,ﬂ Faylaq ash-Sh˜m, the ﬁscholarsﬂ of Syria, the Ikhw˜n, and the judges that ﬁdefected from the Baathist regimeﬂ without a shar™˛ repentance, thus amongst them is the Sur˙r˛, the J˜m˛, the S˙f˛, the Qub˙r˛, the Ash™ar˛, the Jahm˛, the modernist, and the Baathist!3 If the likes of these gather, do they judge by the Shar˛™ah? Or does each party resist from the laws those that it alleges to be opposed to the common good and in support of the greater harm?Some of those mentioned had fallen into apostasy before even being appointed as judges, like those who permit partaking in the shirk˛ democratic elections, or those who seek intercession from the absent and dead, or those who take the Arab and non-Arab taw˜gh˛t as well as the Crusaders as close allies, or those who deny some of the obvious, de˚nite laws of the Shar˛™ah– And if the ﬁindependent committeesﬂ judge that one of the parties must submit to its ruling or call them to such, you see every group ˚nding an excuse and exemption for itself– Also, every area has its conˆicting committees, each of which throws the other™s judgment against the wall.ˇe Sahwah Coalition in reality fought the Islamic 3 ˝e Sur˛r˚ is the ﬁSalaf˚ﬂ Ikhw˜n˚. ˝e J˜m˚ is the blatantly pro-Saudi ﬁSalaf˚.ﬂ ˝e Qub˛r˚ is the grave worshipper. ˝e Ash™ar˚ and the Jahm˚ are both sects that negate Allah™s attribu-tes and adopt irj˜™ in addition to other serious deviations.One of the so-called ﬁshar™˛ﬂ committees that neither implements the hud˚d nor enforces the laws of the Shar˛™ah56FEATUREState and abolished the already established Shar˛™ah and expelled it from its regions. ˇe witness to this is the towns of ad-D˜n˜ and I™z˜z as well as other cities and villages. After the Sahwah Coalition expelled the Islamic State from them more than a year ago, they did not rule these places by the Shar˛™ah and even if they ruled by some of it, they abandoned most of it.ˇe Sahwah Coalition did not rule by the Shar˛™ah in a single village of its villages. Rather, the ˚tnah in their land was manifest, that ˚tnah which Allah (jalla wa ‚al˜) said about, {Fight them until there is no ˚tnah and until worship is for Allah. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors} [Al-Baqarah: 193]. {And ˚ght them until there is no ˚tnah and until the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease Œ then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do} [Al-Anf˜l: 39].Shaykh  said, ﬁShaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah said when he was asked about the issue of ˚ghting the Tatars while they claimed to adhere to the shah˜datayn (testimony of Islam) and claimed to follow the basis of Islam, ‚Every party that resists the obvious and de˚nite laws of Islam from these people or others, then it is obligatory to ˚ght them until they comply with its laws even if they pronounce the shah˜datayn and follow some of its laws, just as Ab˙ Bakr and the Sah˜bah  fought those who resisted the zak˜h. ˇe fuqah˜™ after them agreed upon this.™ He then said, ‚So any resistant party that resists some of the obligatory prayers, fasting, hajj, or resists abiding by the prohibition of spilling blood, looting wealth, alcohol, gambling, incest, or resists adherence to jih˜d against the ku˝˜r or the enforcement of jizyah upon Ahlul-Kit˜b, [in another fatwa of his in ﬁMajm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜ﬂ he adds, ﬁor resists commanding the good and forbidding the evilﬂ] or resists abiding by anything else of the obligations and prohibitions of the religion, those rulings which no one has an excuse for being ignorant of or abandoning and which the individual commits kufr by denying, then the resistant party is fought over these rulings even if it acknowledges them. ˇis is something of which I know no di˝erence between the scholars.™ He said, ‚ˇese Œ according to the most judicious scholars Œ are not on the same level as the bugh˜t (the rebels). Rather they have exited Islam on the level of those who resisted zak˜h.™ – So if a person who adheres to all the laws of the religion but forcefully resists the prohibition of gambling, usury, or fornication is a k˜˚r whom it is obligatory to ˚ght, how much more so is the case of he who practices shirk with Allah and is called to o˝er the religion sincerely to Allah and declare bar˜™ah and kufr towards everything worshipped besides Allah, but instead he arrogantly refuses and is from the k˜˚r˛nﬂ [Tays˛r al-‚Az˛z al-Ham˛d].His father, Shaykh ‚Abdull˜h Ibn Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b  commented upon the fatw˜ of Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah about the Tatars, ﬁMay Allah  have mercy upon you, reˆect upon the Im˜m™s clari˚cation in this fatw˜ A group of Christians in Wil˜yat ar-Raqqah who pay jizyah, as seen in the video ﬁUntil There Came to Them Clear EvidenceﬂA man from Ahl adh-Dhimmah in Wil˜yat ar-Raqqah, as seen in the video ﬁUntil There Came to Them Clear Evidenceﬂ57dabiqthat the one who forcefully resists a law from the laws of Islam, like the ˚ve prayers, fasting, zak˜h, or hajj, or forcefully resists abandoning the forbidden matters like fornication, murder, theft and plunder, alcohol, or intoxicants, and so forth, then it is obligatory to ˚ght the party resisting such until the religion is only for Allah alone and until they abide by all laws of Islam, even if they pronounce the shah˜dah and hold on to some of the laws of Islam, and that this is something that all the scholars have agreed upon, since the Companions and those after them, and that this is in accordance with the Qur™˜n and the Sunnah. ˇus, it becomes clear to you that the mere adherence to Islam coupled with the resistance to some of its laws does not save them from war and that they are to be fought because of their kufr and apostasy from Islam as he made clear in the end of his fatw˜ﬂ [Al-Kalim˜t an-N˜˚™ah].Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah said, explaining the obligation to ˚ght the resistant parties, ﬁˇis is because Allah said in His book, {And ˚ght them until there is no ˚tnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah} [Al-Anf˜l: 39]. So, if some of the religion is for Allah and some of it is for other than Allah it becomes obligatory to ˚ght them until the religion is for Allah alone. He said, {But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zak˜h, let them [go] on their way} [At-Tawbah: 5]. He did not order to let them go except after their repentance from all types of kufr and after establishing prayer and giving zak˜h. He  said, {O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers. And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger.} [Al-Baqarah: 278-279].4 He  informed us that the resistant party, if it does not desist from usury, it has waged war against Allah and His Messenger. Usury is the last matter that Allah prohibited in the Qur™˜n, so what He prohibited before it is even more certain. He 4 Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah  said, ﬁ˝is ˜yah was revealed concerning the people of at-T˜™if when they entered Islam, abided by prayer and fasting, but resisted abandoning usury. ˝us, Allah clariˇed that they were waging war against Him and His Messenger if they did not desist from usury. Usury is the last matter that Allah prohibited and it is wealth that is taken with the content of its owner. So if these people were waging war against Allah and His Messenger and it was obligatory to perform jih˜d against them, how much more so is the case of those who have abandoned many of the laws of Islam or most of themﬂ [Majm˛™ al-Fat˜w˜].said, {Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or cruci˚ed or that their hands and feet be cut o˝ from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land} [Al-M˜™idah: 33].5 ˇus, any of those who forcefully resist obeying Allah and His Messenger have waged war against Allah and His Messenger. And whoever implements upon this Earth something other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger has thus strived to spread corruption on the Earthﬂ [Majm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜].And from amongst those who confused the people about the Sahw˜t are the jih˜d claimants in the Jawl˜n˛ front and other similar groups. ˇe people considered them to be the ﬁmost Islamicﬂ factions in the Sahwah Coalition. So we ask them, is the person who admits that he is not ruling by the Shar˛™ah right now and not imposing jizyah on the Christians in the ﬁliberated regionsﬂ despite his ability to do so, is he ruling by the Shar˛™ah?Jawl˜n˛ said, ﬁˇe situation of the Christians right now is that we do not ˚ght other than those who ˚ght us, and the Christians are not ˚ghting us now. If we establish Islamic rule in the region, they will submit to the Islamic system of rule that we have with us. In addition, concerning the matter of paying jizyah, whoever is able to pay will pay, and whoever does not have the ability to pay will not pay – Right now, we do not impose anything on them – We do not have a war with the Christians right now. We do not hold the Christians responsible for what America is doing, nor do we hold them responsible for what the Coptic Christians are doing in Egyptﬂ [AlJazeera: Bil˜ Hud˙d Œ Part 1].If waging war is compulsory against those who abstain from imposing jizyah on Ahlul-Kit˜b, then what about those who ˚ght the Islamic State 5 Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah  said, ﬁIt was said that the cause behind the revelation of this verse was those belonging to the ‚Uraynah tribe who had committed apostasy and mur-der and plundered wealth [Reported by Ab˛ D˜w˛d with a sah˚h isn˜d from Anas]. And it was said that the cause was a covenant-holding people who broke their covenant and waged war. And it was said that it referred to the mushrik˚n. ˝us it gathers between the war-wa-ging apostates, the war-waging covenant breakers, and the war-waging mushrik˚n. ˝e ma-jority from the Salaf and those aˆer them say it also encompasses the highway robbers from amongst the Muslims. And the verse encompasses all of theseﬂ [Majm˛™ al-Fat˜w˜].58FEATUREŒ which alone imposes jizyah on Ahlul-Kit˜b in Sh˜m Œ and cancels this divine ruling from some of the lands by ˚ghting the Islamic State, in addition to those rules that the Jawl˜n˛ front and its allies are not implementing?Also, the Sahwah coalition consists of the ﬁFree Syrian Army,ﬂ the ﬁSh˜miyyah Front,ﬂ ﬁFaylaq ash-Sh˜m,ﬂ ﬁJaysh al-Islam,ﬂ the ﬁJawl˜n˛ front,ﬂ6 and amongst them are nationalists, democracy advocates, Sural˙l, and proponents of ﬁpopulist jih˜d.ﬂ Will such people cooperate on ruling by the Shar˛™ah? And if they form a coalition against the Islamic State, is it permissible for the Shar˛™ah claimant to join their coalition and support them in ˚ghting the Islamic State? And if the power in the coalition is for other than Allah™s Shar˛™ah Œ and this is the reality Œ is their action considered to be merely requesting the help of the ku˝˜r against the Muslims, which is absolutely prohibited and blatant deviance, or is it considered to be aiding the ku˝˜r against the Muslims, which is extreme apostasy! And those who permitted seeking the help of the ku˝˜r against other ku˝˜r (not against Muslims) listed many conditions, which are not ful˚lled by the Shar˛™ah claimants in the action they take with their allies from amongst the apostate factions against the Islamic State.ˇeir action in reality is a form of aiding the ku˝˜r against Islam and the Muslims. ˇe evidence is that in the lands they take from the Islamic State, the religion is not for Allah, and if some of it is for Allah, most of it is for other than Allah Œ for the desires, opinions, traditions, codes, manmade laws, and factions.Shaykh ‚Abdul-Lat˛f Ibn ‚Abdir-Rahm˜n Ibn Hasan Ibn  Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdul-Wahh˜b , in refutation of those who permit supporting the apostates against the Muslims under the claim that they are only seeking their help, said, ﬁAs for your 6 Refer to the series ﬁ˝e Allies of al-Q˜™idah in Sh˜mﬂ (issues 8, 9, and 10 of D˜biq) to read about the apostasy of the allies of the Jawl˜n˚ front. So will the Jawl˜n˚ front establish Shar˚™ah together with those who appeal to the people™s desires (the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ led by Zahran Alloush), or with those who pledge allegiance to the t˜gh˛t Salm˜l Sal˛l (ﬁFay-laq ash-Sh˜mﬂ), or with those who call to national unity and to sanctify the blood of the B˜tin˚ sects and to respect the Sykes-Picot borders (the ﬁSh˜miyyah Frontﬂ)? And these, along with other factions are the ones who receive conditional aid from the taw˜gh˚t, for there is no aid without conditions as al-Jawl˜n˚ himself stated in his interview, and as the donkey of knowledge, al-Maqdis˚, stated in his ﬁtweets.ﬂpermitting to seek their support, the argument is not on this issue, but rather on the issue of allying with them and bringing them here, and giving them control over an Islamic land wherein they demolished the rites of Islam, the principles of the religion, its fundamentals and its branches. And with their leaders is a set of manmade laws and a t˜gh˙t whom they setup in order to judge between people concerning their blood, their wealth, and other matters, with laws that oppose and go against the shar™˛ texts. If any issue arises, they look into it and judge by the manmade laws, and throw the book of Allah behind their backs.ﬂﬁAs for the issue of seeking help from them [meaning against other ku˝˜r], it is a matter in which there is a di˝erence of opinion. ˇe correct position, which the leading scholars are upon, is that it is completely prohibited. ˇeir evidence is the had˛th narrated by ‚™ishah (radiyall˜hu anh˜) which is agreed upon by al-Bukh˜r˛ and Muslim, and the had˛th narrated by ‚Abdur-Rahm˜n Ibn Hab˛b which is authentic and marf˙™. Look for them and you will ˚nd them in the texts you have with you. ˇose who say it is permissible use as evidence a mursal from az-Zuhr˛, and you know how mursal narrations are treated when they contradict the Qur™an and Sunnah. Furthermore, those who say it is permissible place some conditions: that it should be done for the good of the Muslims and the desire to bene˚t them, whereas in this case it contains destruction and devastation for them. ˇey also stipulate that the mushrik˛n should not have a fearful degree of power and authority, and this invalidates your position in this particular case. ˇey also stipulate that the mushrik should not have any inˆuence in opinion and decision-making, which is the opposite of what is taking place in this case. All this has been mentioned by the scholars of ˚qh and the had˛th commentators, and [ash-Shawk˜n˛] has mentioned this in ‚Sharh al-Muntaq˜™ [‚Naylul-Awt˜r™] and has declared the mursal narration of az-Zuhr˛ very weak. And all this is regarding a mushrik ˚ghting with the Muslims against another mushrik. As for a Muslim seeking the help of a mushrik against a b˜gh˛ (outlaw), then no one has allowed this other than those who have strayedﬂ [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah].59dabiqHe also said on the same issue, ﬁˇe reality of the matter is more severe and far greater than the issue of merely seeking help and support. It is allying with them and removing the barrier protecting the people of Islam and tawh˛d from them, removing the principles and fundamentals of Islam, shedding the blood of the Muslims, and violating their honor and wealth. ˇis is the reality of the present situation. Because of this, open shirk and blatant kufr started to appear in the land to the extent that not even a trace of Islam remained to refer back to or depend on for salvation. How so, when the principles of tawh˛d and ˛m˜n were destroyed, the rulings of the Qur™an and Sunnah were set aside, the ˚rst generations Œ from amongst the people of Badr and Bay™at ar-Ridw˜n Œ were openly cursed, and shirk and R˜˚d˛ Sh˛™ism emerged openly in those places and lands? And those who reduce the present situation to simply being a matter of seeking help from them, neither understand the issue, nor are aware of the disaster and calamity that has taken placeﬂ [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah].And this is similar to their situation, for when the Islamic State was expelled from some of the lands that were under its control, the Free Syrian Army and the so-called ﬁIslamicﬂ factions supported by the taw˜gh˛t of Qatar, Turkeyal˙l entered those lands, raised the banners of j˜hil˛ secularism, and took down the banners of Tawh˛d and Sunnah. ˇey imprisoned the muh˜jir˛n and muh˜jir˜t, and passed judgment upon their blood, honor, and wealth according to their whims. ˇey closed down the Shar˛™ah courts and replaced them with the laws of the factions and their committees which, even if they judged by a law that happened to agree with the law of the Shar˛™ah in some case, or judged by some of what Allah revealed, they nonetheless were not judging by most of the laws of the Shar˛™ah, and they abandoned them for the ˚tnah that the Muslims were ordered to bring an end to with death and war.So we say to them as the muj˜hid leader Sa™˙d Ibn ‚Abdil-‚Az˛z Ibn Muhammad Ibn Sa™˙d ( Œ died 1229 AH)7 in his letter to the Ottoman8 leader in Baghdad, Sulaym˜n B˜sh˜, ﬁWe only ˚ght and declare the kufr of one who commits shirk with Allah, sets up a partner for Allah whom he calls upon just as he calls upon Allah, whom he slaughters for just as he slaughters for Allah, whom he vows oaths to just as he vows oaths to Allah, whom he fears just as he fears Allah, and whom he seeks rescue from at times of distress and need, as well as he who ˚ghts in defense of the idols and the domes built upon the graves, which have been taken as idols that are worshipped besides Allah. If you are truthful in your claim that you are upon the religion of Islam and are the followers of the Messenger , then demolish all those idols and ˆatten them to the ground, and repent to Allah from all shirk and bid™ah. Actualize the statement ‚ˇere is god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.™ And whoever directs an act of worship to other than Allah from amongst the dead or living, prohibit him from doing so, and inform him that this is a matter that nulli˚es one™s Islam and resembles the 7 Note: ˝e muj˜hid leader Sa™˛d Ibn ‚Abdil-‚Az˚z Ibn Muhammad Ibn Sa™˛d ( Œ died 1229 AH) is not to be confused with the murtadd t˜gh˛t Sa™˛d Ibn ‚Abdil-‚Az˚z Ibn ‚Ab-dir-Rahm˜l Sa™˛d (perished 1388 AH). Furthermore, there™s a di˙erence between that which is referred to historically as the ﬁˇrst Saudi state,ﬂ which was established by the mu-j˜hid leader Muhammad Ibn Sa™˛d and his early grandsons  and with which he sup-ported Im˜m Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b, and between the ﬁthird Saudi stateﬂ of the present era, which is the state of the murtadd t˜gh˛t ‚Abdul-‚Az˚z Ibn ‚Abdir-Rahm˜n (perished 1373 AH) and his grandsons who allied with the crusaders and who rule by manmade laws.8 Some of the people, due to their ignorance, refer to this state as the ﬁOttoman Khil˜fahﬂ even though it was ruling by manmade laws and spreading the mushrik S˛f˚ tar˚qas, as was most apparent in its ˇnal stages when it was defending tombs and waging war against the da™wah that was renewed by Im˜m Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b . In addition to this, it did not fulˇll the condition of having a Qurash˚ ruler.Destroying a symbol of shirkin the city of Mosul60FEATUREreligion of the idol-worshippers. And, if he does not refrain from that except if he is fought, then it is obligatory to ˚ght him until he makes the religion, all of it, for Allah.

It is collected from the wealthy and given to the eligible people whom Allah has mentioned. If you do this then you are our brothers. You will have the same rights as we have and you will have the same responsibilities as we have. Your blood and wealth will be prohibited for us. If, however, you continue upon this condition that you are in, and do not repent from the shirk that you are upon and adhere to the religion of Allah with which He sent His Messenger and abandon shirk and bid™ah, we will continue to ˚ght you until you return to Allah™s religion, and traverse its straight path as Allah has commanded us to do, as in His statement, {And ˚ght them until there is no ˚tnah and until the religion, all of it, is for Allah} [Al-Anf˜l: 39]. And He  said, {ˇen kill the mushrik˛n wherever you ˚nd them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zak˜h, let them go on their way} [At-Tawbah: 5]ﬂ [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah].He  also stated in another letter, ﬁIf you claim that you do not worship other than Allah and are not pleased with such a deed, and do not encourage the people to do so, your actions Œ both public and private Œ disprove your claims. ˇese false S˙f˛ gatherings, accursed sites, and structures built over the graves, along with the act of directing Allah™s rights to these graves, including du™˜™, sacri˚ce, oaths, fear and hope, and asking them for that which should not be asked for except from Allah, as well as praying there, touching them with the hope of attaining blessings, o˝ering gifts to them, and other such disgusting and hideous activities, all exist among you openly. And he who does not take part in such deeds is pleased with them, and he defends the people who do these deeds with his wealth, his tongue, and his hands.ﬂﬁˇe ˚ve daily prayers are likewise abandoned, and most of your people do not attend the jumu™ah or congregational prayer, nor do they pray individually. And most of those amongst you who do pray, pray individually at home, and those who attend congregational prayer are few in number. When one of them attends the prayer, he comes out and ˚nds the people in the markets, abandoning the prayer and immersed in sin, play, immorality, and wrongs, and he does not denounce them.ﬂﬁˇe zak˜h is likewise abandoned. It is not taken from the people™s wealth, nor are their crops counted, nor is the work of Allah™s Messenger  in that regard undertaken, nor is the zak˜h due on the crops collected, nor spent upon those designated as eligible recipients by Allah from above the seven heavens, as the Prophet  said, ‚Allah was not pleased with having the recipients of zak˜h designated by a prophet or anyone else. Rather, He divided it Himself and took responsibility of designating its recipients with His statement, {Zak˜h expenditures are only for the poor and for The implementation of the hadd for theft in MosulThe men of hisbah (commanding good and forbidding evil) sieze and destroy a large quantity of cigarettes, alcohol, and other har˜m items61dabiqthe needy and for those employed to collect zak˜h and for bringing hearts together for Islam and for freeing captives or slaves and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the stranded traveler Œ an obligation imposed by Allah.

Rather, he supports them with his wealth and his tongue. So even if he doesn™t commit these sins, he and those who commit them are equal, as Allah said, {And it has already been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them until they engage in a talk other than that; otherwise you would be like them} [An-Nis˜™: 140].

He will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers ˆow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence. ˇat is the great attainment.

And the other verses and ah˜d˛th that talk about jih˜d and encourage it cannot be counted. And we have no custom other than jih˜d, and we have no source of sustenance other than the wealth of the ku˝˜r.ﬂHe then continued, until he said, ﬁAs for having a truce while you are upon other than Islam, then by Allah™s might and power, this is something impossible. And you know that this is a matter that you™ve requested from us again and again. You sent us ‚Abdul-‚Az˛z al-Qad˛m˛, and then you sent us ‚Abdul-‚Az˛z Beg, and you requested from us a truce and o˝ered to pay jizyah in the amount of thirty thousand gold dinars every year, but we did not accept that from you and did not respond to your request for a truce. If you accept Islam, you will enjoy its goodness, and that is what we seek, and if you refuse then we say to you as Allah  said, {But if they turn away, they are only in dissension, and Allah will be su˘cient for you against them.

May Allah™s blessings and peace be upon Muhammad, and upon his family and companionsﬂ [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah].9In his words there is a description of the situation in the lands ruled by the Sahwah Coalition. It should be noted that this is quoted in relation to the matter of one who forcefully resists against the laws of Shar˛™ah, and that the only thing that prevents one from being fought and killed is to rule by the Shar˛™ah, adhere to its laws, and disassociate oneself from those who forcefully resist the Shar˛™ah and its laws.Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned the obligation of ˚ghting the heretical parties that forcefully resist adopting the ‚aq˛dah of Ahlus-Sunnah concerning the tawh˛d of Allah™s names and attributes, Qad˜™ and Qadar, the Sah˜bah, and the Jam˜™ah [Majm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜: vol. 28, pg. 511]. So how can those factions who are even more deviant not be fought? How is it that those who dignify the taw˜gh˛t ‚Abdull˜h and Sal˙l, Hamd and Trdogan and the Syrian National Coalition (may Allah curse them) and declare them along with their governments to be brothers and friends, how are they not to be fought? ˇey also mock those who make takf˛r of the taw˜gh˛t and those who openly show their hatred and enmity towards the taw˜gh˛t, claiming that whoever makes takf˛r of the taw˜gh˛t is a ﬁfoolﬂ 9 Anyone who reads this and other letters of the muj˜hid leader Sa™˛d Ibn ‚Abdil-‚Az˚z (re-fer to footnote 7) will know the di˙erence between a muwahhid muj˜hid and the claimants to tawh˚d and jih˜d.who doesn™t know politics, or is a ﬁkh˜rij˛ﬂ! ˇen they approve of the blatant acts of kufr committed by the taw˜gh˛t, such as entering into the religion of democracy, j˜hil˛ nationalism, the United Nations, and international law! And how is it the case that others are not to be fought even though they give preference to their allies amongst the nationalist factions over and above the muh˜jir˛n and ans˜r of the Islamic State, thereby preferring the allies of the t˜gh˙t over those waging jih˜d for the cause of Allah, and even entering into a coalition with them against those ruling by the Shar˛™ah, and referring to those ruling by the Shar˛™ah as ﬁKhaw˜rijﬂ while referring to those forcefully resisting obvious, de˚nite shar™˛ laws as ﬁMuslim muj˜hid˛nﬂ?Shaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah said, ﬁAllah said, {And ˚ght them until there is no ˚tnah and until the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease Œ then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do} [Al-Anf˜l: 39]. So whoever abandons the ˚ghting which Allah has commanded in order to avoid ˚tnah, will fall into ˚tnah because of the doubt and illness in his heart, and because he abandoned what Allah has commanded of jih˜d. So ponder over this, for this is a serious matterﬂ [Majm˙™ al-Fat˜w˜].So O soldiers of the Islamic State, charge into the ranks of the murtadd˛n who forcefully resist the laws of the Shar˛™ah, and remember that Allah is higher and greater than the warplanes of the crusaders that these murtadd˛n rely upon and seek to be rescued by.The t˜gh˚t of Qatar together with the t˜gh˚t of Turkey64FEATUREAs for you, O you who left your home and claimed to be waging jih˜d for the cause of Allah and to make Allah™s word the highest and the word of those who disbelieve the lowest, and then fought in the ranks of the Sahwah Coalition against the Islamic State, look around you, in front of you, behind you, to your right, to your left, and above you. Don™t you see the allies of the taw˜gh˛t? Don™t you see those who spread corruption on the Earth? Don™t you see the spies prowling amidst the lands? Don™t you see the ˚ghter jets above them protecting them? Are you ˚ghting so that these people can rule the blessed land of Sh˜m? Do you see the jizyah being imposed upon Ahlul-Kit˜b? Do you see the hud˙d being implemented in the land? Do you see the people being ordered with prayer, zak˜h, chastity, and hij˜b? Or are the people left ﬁfree,ﬂ regardless of whether they worship Allah or worship the taw˜gh˛t?So O you who claims support and jih˜d, O you who left your home and travelled to Sh˜m claiming hijrah while residing in the territories of the Sahwah Coalition, repent to Allah and wake up, for by Allah you are ˚ghting the Shar˛™ah whether you realize it or not. So gather your brothers, rise in unison, and kill those who order you to ˚ght against those who rule with the Shar˛™ah. Revolt against your leaders in the Sahwah Coalition, and slaughter them so that the satellite channels of the taw˜gh˛t and the warplanes of the crusaders can cry over them. If you were to kill the Sahwah Coalition in its very stronghold it would be better than carrying out a million operations that help consolidate in the land those who forcefully resist the laws of the Shar˛™ah, operations by which Sh˜m will be ruled by other than what Allah revealed, with the approval of the taw˜gh˛t and the crusaders.So detonate your explosive belt in their midst. Shoot their soldiers in the chest. Dissuade whoever you can from ˚ghting those who rule by the Shar˛™ah. Make them abandon ˚ghting the muwahhid muj˜hid˛n, and spread discouragement within their ranks. ˇen, if you are not able to overtake their lands, rule those lands by the Shar˛™ah, and openly declare your bay™ah to the Khal˛fah, and if you do not have the courage to charge into their midst and kill as many of them as you can and support the Khil˜fah, then make hijrah to the land of the Khil˜fah, for by Allah, it is the best land for he who wants to make hijrah to Allah.O Allah, Revealer of the Book, Swift to take account, Mover of the clouds, defeat the parties, shake them, and support us against them. O Allah, resurrect the muftis of the Sahw˜t and the donkeys of knowledge together with Bal™˜m Ibn B˜™˙r, Ibn Ab˛ Du™˜d, at-Tant˜w˛, and al-B˙t˛.1010 Bal™˜m Ibn B˜™˛r is reported in the Isr˜™˚liyy˜t and mentioned by some of the mufassir˚n to have been a man from Ban˚ Isr˜™˚l who had been given knowledge of Allah™s greatest name, and used it to call upon Allah and make du™˜™ against M˛s˜ , thereby losing both his duny˜ and his hereaˆer. Ibn Ab˚ Du™˜d was one of the Mu™tazilah who led the ˇtnah in which it was claimed that the Qur™˜n was created, until it was brought to an end by Im˜m Ahmad . ˝e murtadd Muhammad Syed at-Tant˜w˚ was the former ﬁShaykhul-Azhar,ﬂ an Egyptian palace scholar whose legacy included permitting usury, banning the niq˜b in al-Azhar University, and waging war against the muj˜hid˚n. ˝e murtadd Muhammad Sa™˚d Ramad˜n al-B˛t˚ was a Syrian palace scholar that stood in support of the t˜gh˛t Bas-har throughout the jih˜d in Sh˜m until he was eventually killed.The pro-Nusayr˛ palace scholar Muhammad Sa™˛d Ramad˜n al-B˚t˛, killed by the muwahhid muj˜hid˛nThe deceased palace scholar, Muhammad Syed at-Tant˜w˛, exchanges greetings with the former leader of the Jewish state, Shimon Perez65dabiq66ENEMY˚S WORDSKurdish opposition in the battles against the ˚ghters of the ‚Islamic State™ organization.ﬂ He also said, ﬁˇese strikes constitute indirect support for Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m and Jabhat an-Nusrah.ﬂ (He forgets the calls made out to the Crusader Coalition by leaders in Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m and the Sh˜miyyah Front via satellite television and internet tweets.) He also said that the airstrikes indicate the presence of ﬁan American decision to prevent the advances of the ‚Islamic State™ organization from Sawr˜n to the border city of I™z˜z adjacent to Turkeyﬂ [Quoted from an article titled ﬁˇe International Coalition Targets Jihadists Near Aleppo in the Interests of Islamic Factions Including an-Nusrah,ﬂ which was published by the website of the ﬁSyrian Observatoryﬂ on ﬁ8 June 2015ﬂ].It seems that the policy of the crusaders towards the Jawl˜n˛ front is a copy of the policy of the taw˜gh˛t towards the front. And so just as the taw˜gh˛t of Turkey, Qatar, and al˙l support the factions of ﬁJayshul-Fathﬂ (the Army of Conquest) with conditional aid (unconditional aid does not exist, as Jawl˜n˛ himself testi˚ed in his interview with AlJazeera), then the aid is distributed amongst all the participant factions in ﬁJayshul-Fathﬂ including the Jawl˜n˛ front, similarly the crusaders target the Khil˜fah in the interests of the Sahwah Coalition despite the ˇe muj˜hid˛n are not used to seeing the jets of the cross and t˜gh˙t striking the ﬁKhaw˜rijﬂ in defense of ﬁAhlus-Sunnah wal-Jam˜™ahﬂ except in the era of the so-called ﬁArab Spring.ﬂ So when the jets of the wicked ku˝˜r come to strike and defend the Sahwah Coalition Œ including the Jawl˜n˛ front Œ and help the Sahwah Coalition advance against the Islamic State under the cover of the Crusader Coalition, then know that despite the severe violence among themselves and despite the disagreement of their hearts1, they are but allies of one another2.And so, after the army of the Khil˜fah overtook Sawr˜n I™z˜z and expelled the humiliated Sahwah Coalition from it, the Syrian National Coalition and the heads of the factions and councils in Turkey called for the help of America on behalf of the Sahwah Coalition (leaders of Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m and the Sh˜miyyah Front did not forget to partake in this supplication), and the two Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham exerted pressure on the holder of the crusader banner, Obama. So Obama replied to their requests, and the Islamic State was struck in Sawr˜n I™z˜z and adjacent areas on ﬁ7 June 2015,ﬂ and ﬁ14 June 2015,ﬂ as well as on other days and nights, all the strikes serving the interests of the Sahwah Coalition.ˇe ﬁSyrian Observatory for Human Rightsﬂ (chaired by the apostate Rami Abdulrahman) commented on the event in a release on ﬁ7 June 2015,ﬂ ﬁˇe jets of the International and Arab coalition executed at least 4 airstrikes targeting the locations and assemblies of the ‚Islamic State™ organization in the village of Sawr˜n I™z˜z in the northern countryside of Aleppo, which has been witnessing for about ten days severe clashes between the ‚Islamic State™ organization on one side and on the other side: Jabhat an-Nusrah Œ Tandh˛m al-Q˜™idah f˛ Bil˜d ash-Sh˜m Œ with the Islamic and military factions. ˇe area also witnessed exchanges of strikes between the two sides and the destruction of vehicles belonging to the ‚Islamic State™ organization carried out by ˚ghters of an-Nusrah and the other factions with the usage of American TOW missiles.ﬂˇe chairman of the ﬁSyrian Observatory for Human Rights,ﬂ Rami Abdulrahman said, ﬁˇis is the ˚rst time that the International Coalition supports the non-1 In reference to verse 14 of S˛rat al-Hashr.2 In reference to verse 51 of S˛rat al-M˜™idah.The murtaddRami AbdulrahmanThe murtaddRami Abdulrahman67dabiqpresence of the Jawl˜n˛ front in this coalition. ˇis is from the mutual ﬁpragmatismﬂ between the American administration and the Sahwah Coalition containing the Jawl˜n˛ front. ﬁDo not rule by the Shar˛™ah so that we strike your enemies.ﬂ ﬁHalt operations against the crusaders or else we will bombard you.ﬂ It is the politics of the carrot and stick.ˇis might be the beginning of the implementation of proposals made by crusader think tanks, some of which were quoted in the last issue of D˜biq, in the section titled ﬁIn the Words of the Enemy.ﬂ ˇe matter might have depended on the crusaders™ killing of leaders in al-Q˜™idah so that the organization submits fearfully alongside their brothers in the T˜lib˜n emirate to American politics. Now just as the T˜lib˜n do not pose a threat towards the safety and security of the crusader homeland, al-Q˜™idah no longer poses a threat. ˇis became the case after Dhaw˜hir˛ adopted new policies opposing the policies of the muj˜hid Shaykh Us˜mah Ibn L˜din . So Dhaw˜hir˛ made the crusader lands secure, the taw˜gh˛t secure, the post-ﬁArab Springﬂ taw˜gh˛t secure, the Ikhw˜n˛ taw˜gh˛t secure, the armies of apostasy secure, and the R˜˚d˛ mobs and savages secure [As in the Jawl˜n˛ interview with AlJazeera and as in ﬁGeneral Guidelines for Jih˜d˛ Actionﬂ by Dhaw˜hir˛].Rather the matter surpassed even this to the point that the ﬁclear-cut maslahah (interest)ﬂ was in abandoning the implementation of the Shar˛™ah and its laws! A ﬁpragmaticﬂ policy, or so the crusaders claim. ˇe New York Times also said on ﬁ9 June 2015ﬂ in an article titled ﬁAl Qaeda Tries a New Tactic to Keep Power: Sharing It,ﬂ ﬁAfter they routed the army in southern Yemen, ˚ghters from Al Qaeda stormed into the city of Al Mukalla, seizing government buildings, releasing jihadists from prison and stealing millions of dollars from the central bank. ˇen they surprised everyone. Instead of raising their ˆags and imposing Islamic law, they passed control to a civilian council and gave it a budget to pay salaries, import fuel and hire teams to clean up garbage. ˇe ˚ghters receded into the background, maintaining only a single police station to arbitrate disputes–ﬂﬁ[ˇe] branches [of Al Qaeda] in Yemen and Syria are now increasingly making common cause with local groups on the battle˚eld–ﬂ ﬁAl Qaeda™s branches in Syria and Yemen have taken a di˝erent route [from the Islamic State], building ties with local groups and refraining from the strict application of Shariah, the legal code of Islam, when faced with local resistance, according to residents of areas where Al Qaeda holds sway. When Al Qaeda took over Al Mukalla in April, it seized government buildings and used trucks to cart o˝ more than $120 million from the central bank – But it soon passed control to a civilian council, giving it a budget of more than $4 million to provide services, an arrangement that made sense to local o˘cials seeking to serve their people during wartime. ‚We are not Qaeda stooges,™ said Abdul-Hakeem bin Mahfood, the council™s secretary general, in a telephone interview. ‚We formed the council to avoid the destruction of the city.™ While the council pays salaries and distributes fuel, Al Qaeda maintains a police station to settle disputes, residents said.

It recently joined a rebel coalition called the Army of Conquest, putting itself in the same trenches as groups that receive support from the West. ‚ˇey are Muslims, no di˝erent from us,™ said Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the Nusra Front™s leader, in a recent interview with Al Jazeera. He also said his group had been ordered by Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda™s global leader, not to carry out foreign attacks that could disrupt the ˚ght against Assad–ﬂﬁCivilians living in Nusra Front areas, too, say the group has built local support, refraining from imposing Shariah when residents resisted. Meanwhile, its ˚ghters have distributed food and ˚xed plumbing systems. In the village of Binnish, it recently ˚elded a team in a friendly soccer match against another rebel group. Nusra™s team wore fatigues in line with Islamic modesty, and it lost against players wearing shorts. ‚Nusra are not extremists,™ said an activist who attended the game... ‚ˇey distribute leaˆets at checkpoints and call people to the religion.™ﬂIn light of the policies of the taw˜gh˛t towards al-Q˜™idah in Syria, the author and apostate journalist Ahmed Rashid wrote in ﬁNew York Review of Booksﬂ on ﬁ15 June 2015ﬂ an article clarifying the condition of rapprochement and reconciliation between the t˜gh˙t regimes and al-Q˜™idah. ˇe title of the article was ﬁWhy We Need al-Qaedaﬂ! Some of what he said was, ﬁCould the group long considered the most lethal terrorist organization in the world be the best option left in the Middle East for the US and its allies? – [M]embers of the US-led coalition against ISIS, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, are actively supporting al-Nusra with arms and money [indirect support, through opposition joint operations chambers and military, civilian, and local councils, and with the approval and awareness of the aid-providing countries]. – [M]uch of the Arab world is now essentially siding with AQAP in a Saudi-led war against Houthi rebels in that country. – ˇe truth is that al-Qaeda has evolved in profound ways since the death of Osama bin Laden and the emergence of ISIS. – It also has increasingly set itself apart from ISIS in strategy and aims on battle˚elds in both Syria and Yemen–ﬂﬁIn this war the Arab states openly avoid bombing or attacking al-Nusra and AQAP, and in fact now provide both with ˚nancial support and weapons [indirectly, through the factions allied with them]. ˇis is because both groups have now declared aims that are shared by the Arab states. – So al-Nusra and AQAP have become allies and not enemies of the Arab states, despite the fact that al-Qaeda itself once sought to overthrow these same regimes–ﬂﬁ[T]he Arabs are justi˚ed in concluding that al-Qaeda may be evolving. Both groups have now taken over cities and towns in their respective states – And both have set out policies of local control that di˝er markedly from those of ISIS.ﬂﬁConsider al-Nusra, ISIS™s primary rival in Syria. Unlike ISIS, – al-Nusra is cooperating with other anti-Assad groups and recently joined the ﬁArmy of Conquestﬂ alliance of rebel militias in northern Syria. Moreover, in contrast to ISIS™s largely international and non-Syrian ˚ghting force, al-Nusra™s ˚ghters are almost wholly Syrian, making them both more reliable and more committed to Syria™s future. Meanwhile, in interviews with Al Jazeera, al-Nusra leaders have vowed not to attack targets in the West, promoting an ideology that might be called ‚nationalist jihadism™ rather than global jihad. In recent months, al-Nusra™s leaders have toned down the implementation of their own brutal version of Islamic law, while putting on hold their own plans of building a caliphate.ﬂﬁMany of these same changes have been evident with AQAP in Yemen. – ˇe group seized the capital Mukallah, robbed the bank, and then retreated, declining to run the government themselves or impose sharia law The murtadd Ahmed Rashid69dabiqand installing a council of elders instead. ˇey have urged the council to focus on governance and providing services to the people–ﬂYaroslav Tro˚mov wrote a similar piece for the Wall Street Journal on ﬁ11 June 2015ﬂ titled ﬁTo U.S. Allies, Al Qaeda A˘liate in Syria Becomes the Lesser Evil Œ As Islamic State gains ground, calls to reach out to the Nusra Front intensify.ﬂ In it he said, ﬁIn the three-way war ravaging Syria, should the local al Qaeda branch be seen as the lesser evil to be wooed rather than bombed? ˇis is increasingly the view of some of America™s regional allies and even some Western o˘cials. – ˇe three main forces left on the ground [in Syria] today are the Assad regime, Islamic State and an Islamist rebel alliance in which the Nusra FrontŠan al Qaeda a˘liate designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and the United NationsŠplays a major role. Outnumbered and outgunned, the more secular, Western-backed rebels have found themselves ˚ghting shoulder to shoulder with Nusra in key battle˚elds. As the Assad regime wobbles and Islamic State, or ISIS, gains ground in both Syria and Iraq, reaching out to the more pragmatic Nusra is the only rational choice left for the international community, supporters of this approach argue–ﬂﬁAt ˚rst, it was mostly Turkey and Qatar that aided Syrian Islamist rebels cooperating with Nusra. Regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia was more reluctant, wary of abetting al Qaeda [by supporting factions allied with the Jawl˜n˛ front]. – In recent months, however, Saudi Arabia™s new King Salman has moved to work much more closely with Doha and Ankara in supporting the Islamist-dominated rebel alliance that includes Nusra, diplomats and o˘cials in the region say. ˇese countries see the su˝ering inˆicted on Syria by the Assad regime as the main reason for Islamic State™s emergence in the ˚rst place, and they prefer to see Nusra and its allies, rather than Islamic State, move into territory surrendered by Damascus–ﬂﬁUnlike Islamic State, Nusra is largely composed of Syrians, and its religious views, though certainly radical, aren™t nearly as extreme. While it has refrained from attacking Israel despite controlling towns along the demarcation line in the Golan Heights, the group has taken on Islamic State and has been willing to work with non-Islamist rebels.ﬂﬁ‚Nusra has been a real magnet for young Syrian ˚ghters who don™t have any particular jihadist or even radical sectarian agenda,™ said Frederic Hof, who served as President Obama™s envoy to the Syrian opposition – Nusra™s attempt to di˝erentiate itself from Islamic State was clear in recent interviews that the group™s leader, Abu Muhammad al Jawlani, gave to Qatar™s Al Jazeera television network. Dressed in a plaid shirt and his face covered, Mr. Jawlani sat in a high-backed, thronelike chair once occupied by Idlib™s former governor. He ˚elded fawning questions during the two separate, nearly hourlong broadcasts, which were widely seen in the region as an e˝ort by Qatar to make Nusra more attractive. While Mr. Jawlani repeated his allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri, he said Nusra wasn™t targeting the West and made conciliatory remarks about the Christian minority–ﬂﬁ[W]ith Islamic State on the o˝ensive, Washington is likely to go ‚pretty far™ in tolerating the budding collaboration between its regional allies and Nusra, said U.S. Navy Adm. James Stavridis, who retired two years ago as NATO™s supreme allied commander. ‚It is unlikely we are going to operate side by side with cadres from Nusra, but if our allies are working with them, that is acceptable. If you look back to World War II, we had coalitions with people that we had extreme disagreements with, including Stalin™s Russia,™ said Mr. Stavridis – ‚I don™t think that is a showstopper for the U.S. in terms of engaging with that coalition.™ﬂDisregarding their news and analysis, still the matter has become the opinion most proposed by the crusaders and apostates to the American administration! So when will the soldiers of the Jawl˜n˛ front repent and realize that their war against the Islamic State only serves the interests of their allies in the Sahwah Coalition that they belong to and the allies of their allies (the Crusader Coalition)?

Zakk˙r said to him, ﬁWe have to help our brothers from the factions present in the arena and stop the oppression of the Islamic State and ˚ght against it.ﬂˇis is in addition to other events I myself witnessed. When for example, some of the leadership of ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ supported the Free Syrian Army with weapons and helped them in ˚ghting against the Islamic State in some regions, as was the case of Hammawdah and Ab˙ Dharr at-T˙nus˛ in the western part of Halab.

And was it di˝erent from the stance of Jawl˜n˛ and those close to him?Abˆ Sam˙r: Ab˙ ‚Abb˜s ad-Dar˛r mentioned to me an incident that makes this apparent.

When the Islamic State found out about the matter, they arrested him. ˝en the Shar˚™ah Court examined his case and ruled that this and other deeds of his were a form of helping the ku˙˜r against the Muslims. He was killed accordingly. Keep in mind that the soldiers of al-Hadram˚ Œ Ab˛ ‚s˜ ar-Raqqah and his faction (Liw˜™ ˝uww˜r ar-Raqqah) Œ are now with the atheist Kurds and Crusaders to ˇght against the Khil˜fah in ‚Ayn al-Isl˜m.State, as Ab˙ M˜riyah had promised him hundreds of ˚ghters and convoys after convoys Œ or so he claimed Œ to ˚ght the Islamic State in ar-Raqqah. When counting the youths that al-Har˜r˛ had gathered for this, it became clear that they were only sixty individuals. So Ab˙ ‚Abb˜s set out with them to ˚ght the Islamic State and on the way something happened that ruined this. One of the soldiers saw a signboard that had drawn on it the ˆag of the Islamic State. So he shouted, ﬁˇe Islamic State will remain!ﬂ So Ab˙ ‚Abb˜s stopped the convoy and said to the soldier, ﬁWhat are you saying?ﬂ He said, ﬁˇe Islamic State will remain. ˇese are our brothers.ﬂ He said to him ﬁDo you not know where you are going?ﬂ He said ﬁI don™t know.ﬂ He said ﬁHow do you not know? You are going to ˚ght the Islamic State. Did Ab˙ M˜riyah not tell you this?ﬂ ˇe soldiers said, ﬁWe do not want to ˚ght the Islamic State and we don™t agree with ˚ghting it. ˇey told us that we were going for rib˜t at the 17th division.ﬂ ˇis incident clearly con˚rmed to me the deception of the Jabhah in the eastern region of Ab˙ M˜riyah even on its soldiers to facilitate the plot and war against the Islamic State.3D˜biq: What was the stance at the time of the rest of the soldiers belonging to the factions that fought the Islamic State? Were they convinced then in ˚ghting the Islamic State in the same way their leaders were?Abˆ Sam˙r: Most of the soldiers of the ﬁIslamicﬂ factions that fought the Islamic State at the time did not approve the war against it. I remember a situation that makes this clear. Jawl˜n˛ said to me that Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m had formed what was called ﬁˇe Crisis Cellﬂ and that it was made up of Ab˙ ‚Al˛ Taybah, Ab˙ Zayd ash-Shar™˛, Ab˙ Jam˛l Qutb, Ab˙ Anas Sar˜qib, and Abul-Khayr. I may have made a mistake with one of the names but four of them I am certain of. ˇis ﬁcrisis cellﬂ came and met Jawl˜n˛. I said to him, ﬁWhat was the reason for them meeting you?ﬂ He said, ﬁˇey came to convince me of the kufr of the Islamic State and that it is an organization working for Iran implementing 3 Editor™s Note: ˝is was during the beginning of the Sahwah. But aˆer those who had a mustard seed of good in their hearts from amongst their soldiers leˆ them and joined the ranks of the Islamic State, no one remained from their soldiers except those whose hearts soaked up the calf of irj˜™ and hizbiyyah even having wal˜™ towards the apostates against the Muslims!Fighters from the Jawl˜n˛ branch of the Sahwah73dabiqthe politics of the R˜˚dah in Sh˜m. And that they are a part of an Iranian plot.ﬂ Jawl˜n˛ claimed that he discussed this with them and said, ﬁˇis is not logical.ﬂ But they were insistent and wanted, through this fatw˜, to convince their soldiers into ˚ghting the Islamic State as most of their soldiers were not convinced in ˚ghting the Islamic State, as most of their soldiers at the time did not agree with the war against the Islamic State and had rejected such a mission. ˇeir leaders were searching for a pretext to convince them of ˚ghting the Islamic State, so they strived to pass the ruling of kufr on the Islamic State and named it ﬁpolitical takf˛r.ﬂ4D˜biq: Some people still think that the agreement of these factions upon ˚ghting the Islamic State was a ﬁcoincidence.ﬂ Is this correct?Abˆ Sam˙r: ˇis is not correct. ˇis mad mobilization did not come as a coincidence. I know through my experience in the ˚eld that Free Syrian Army, other battalions, and even ﬁJabhat an-Nusrah,ﬂ when they want to perform military action, even if it is con˚ned, then it requires from them days and meetings to plan it out, formalize it, and agree upon the roles of each member in the matter. As for something to happen as a coincidence in a day and a night as they claimed and said and as al-Muhaysin˛ claimed, then it is not correct. Rather reality a˘rms that the events occurred through both direct and indirect cooperation amongst the West, the Free Syrian Army, and the various factions. It is not possible for all of the groups to join together at the same time and the same date against the Islamic State in this way.D˜biq: Did you see a speci˚c mission that the Jawl˜n˛ front was trying to achieve?Abˆ Sam˙r: ˇe factions™ mission in Sh˜m is nothing but a distortion of the meaning of h˜kimiyyah and 4 Editor™s Note: When the ranks became distinct from each other and the muh˜jir˚n and ans˜r cooperated to implement the Shar˚™ah and the deviants and the hypocrites coope-rated to ˇght those who ruled by the Shar˚™ah, many of the soldiers of the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ awoke and rushed to give bay™ah to the Islamic State. As for the case now, then the con-dition of the soldiers of the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ is not di˙erent than that of the Jawl˜n˚ front. ˝ey compete to ˇght the Islamic State in defense of the other factions like their own who have resisted the Shar˚™ah and entered the Sahwah Coalition. Also, this is from the many treacheries of Jawl˜n˚. Instead of disavowing them aˆer they proposed this fabrication to him, he told them their claim was not logical and would not be believed by the soldiers. Worse yet, he waged war against the Islamic State in cooperation with their ﬁIslamicﬂ front!this is the ˚tnah of the era. Allah™s law is not just a building called a ﬁcourtﬂ! ˇe laws of Allah and His Shar˛™ah are more vast and more comprehensive than this. ˇe meaning of Allah™s Shar˛™ah now has been distorted and restricted to the domain of the courts and arbitration committees. ˇrough this, the people are being misled into believing that the law of Allah is here. Rather the law of Allah will not be except with a state and an am˛r who enforces the law of Allah upon the people and leads them with the Shar˛™ah.5I can still remember when the biggest moderate ﬁIslamicﬂ brigades in Syria announced the formation of what is called the ﬁIslamic Front.ﬂ When I asked Jawl˜n˛, ﬁIf you rejected the mission of the Islamic State and its means of ruling by Allah™s law upon the Earth and subjugating the people to it, then why do you not join the ‚Islamic Front™ and Dhaw˜hir˛™s project?ﬂ He said, ﬁI know the arena better than Dr. Ayman and we are not pleased with the politics and methodology of the ‚Islamic Front.™ Because of that, we informed Dr. Ayman that we will never 5 Editor™s Note: Similar to the shubhah of courts and committees is the shubhah of press statements and organization names. For example, the Sh˜miyyah Front pronounced the word of kufr through the head of its political and media o, Zakariyy˜ Mal˜, at the convention for the opposition in Turkey. (We quoted his speech in the 2nd part of the ﬁAl-lies of al-Q˜™idah in Sh˜mﬂ series, in issue #8 of D˜biq.) But then it announces in its press statements the claim of judging by the Shar˚™ah and working to establish a Shar˚™ah state. But the clauses of its ﬁshar™˚ﬂ committee are explicit in tolerating all Syrian sects without exception. So what according to these people is the fate of the Nusayr˚yyah, the Druze, the R˜ˇdah and the Ism˜™˚liyyah except for nationalist brotherhood? Likewise is the case of loose titles in Sh˜m such as ﬁAns˜r ash-Shar˚™ah;ﬂ they have not applied the Shar˚™ah nor have they shown hostility to any enemy for the religion™s sake, except for the enemies of the ﬁrevolution.ﬂ As for those others resisting the Shar˚™ah, then they are their allies. ˝ey blow themselves up in order for the likes of ﬁFaylaq ash-Sh˜mﬂ to expand and consolidate, the latter of which has proclaimed its total allegiance to Salm˜n l Sal˛l. ˝us, they made for the t˜gh˛t Salm˜n a foothold in Sh˜m, whether they know it or not. ˝e problem with them is that they allege adherence to the Shar˚™ah but do not enforce its laws like collecting zak˜h, enforcing jizyah, making the apostates repent, and establishing the hud˛d, despite their ability to do so in the regions of Idblib and its countryside.Announcing the formation of the nationalist ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ74INTERVIEWjoin them.ﬂ So I told him, ﬁˇrough this you are announcing a third project in the arena, so what is it? You are not pleased with the Islamic State™s mission and the enforcement of Allah™s rule on the Earth by force, nor are you pleased with the project of popular support and joining the popular base in the lands and in the arena amongst the factions. So what is this third project of yours?ﬂ He went silent and I did not get any reply from him. But then he said, ﬁWe will try to reform the popular support until it is one of sound methodology and proper political orientation.ﬂIt was at that time that Dhaw˜hir˛ dispatched three letters, two for Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m addressed to Ab˙ Kh˜lid as-S˙r˛ and one to Jawl˜n˛. ˇe content of the letter was that Dhaw˜hir˛ called ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ to join the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ and that he condemned the delay in joining this congregation. ˇereupon I asked him about his reply, so he said, ﬁI will not agree to this except with conditions.ﬂ I said to him, ﬁWhat are they?ﬂ He said, ﬁˇat Zahr˜n ‚All˙sh and ‚Jaysh al-Isl˜m™ leave this formation6.ﬂ I said to him, ﬁWhat else?ﬂ He said that the ‚Islamic Front™ had a structure consisting of a general director, a shar™˛ supervisor, and an external political o˘cial who spoke in its name, who was Ab˙ ‚Abdillah al-Hamw˛. He did not want there to be a single o˘cial to receive foreign delegations, but instead insisted on three persons. So I told him, ﬁDo you accept to meet politicians from the taw˜gh˛t?ﬂ He replied, ﬁYes, what is wrong with that?ﬂ And he said, ﬁDid you not witness and hear of the Taliban sitting with Pakistan and Qatar and that it opened an o˘ce in Qatar?ﬂ He wanted to quote the Taliban and their deeds so that he may subsequently do the same, especially after Dhaw˜hir˛™s proclamation of him having a bay™ah to Mull˜ ‚Umar. He basically implied that if ﬁour am˛rﬂ did this, then why can™t we do the same?D˜biq: So what is the path on which the Jawl˜n˛ front treads now?Abˆ Sam˙r: ˇe reality is that ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ does not have a speci˚c path or project with clear features. Because of this and in the shadow of these wicked global designs and the plot against the correct methodology as well as its followers and the attempt to lure and accommodate all the other orientations, we ˚nd today that ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ e˝ectively joined that wicked mission and immersed itself in it. ˇe methodological in˚ltration of ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ pushed it to surrender to regional politics and not have clarity and steadfastness in any of its stances while being in a shadow that scattered the administrative organization and blundered its planning. So the internal and external forces have thereby manipulated the ﬁJabhah.ﬂFrom the clearly ˆoppy images of ﬁJabhat an-6 Editor™s Note: Jawl˜n˚ discredits Zahran Alloush as well as ﬁJaysh al-Isl˜mﬂ and considers their presence in the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ a hindrance to his joining it but then he allies himself with the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ against the Islamic State despite the presence of Zahran Alloush and his army!Ayman adh-Dhaw˜hir˛, a leader with no real authorityAb˚ Kh˜lid as-S˚r˛, a former leader of the nationalist ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ75dabiqNusrahﬂ is that they condemn the actions of the Islamic State and then reality forces them to act exactly the same way because there is no other way leading to consolidation than the one the Islamic State treads on. Likewise are their stances concerning the factions which they take as allies. For example, while condemning the Islamic State for pronouncing takf˛r upon the ﬁIslamic Front,ﬂ the shar™˛ o˘cial Ab˙ Muhammad (Ab˙ ‚Abdillah ash-Sh˜m˛) had before described the ﬁIslamic Frontﬂ as being the ﬁFuture Hamasﬂ (referring to the deviant methodology of Hamas and their ruling by manmade laws). And he is from the most knowledgeable people concerning their condition. ˇis is because he used to be one of them and because three of his brothers are leaders in Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m, amongst them is his brother Ab˙l-Khayr who was the deputy of Ab˙ ‚Abdillah al-Hamw˛ and who was killed together with him in the famous explosion. And he used to describe them as the ﬁFuture Hamasﬂ! Jawl˜n˛ himself told me, ﬁAhr˜r ash-Sh˜m are the Sahw˜t of the future, but the Islamic State rushed too quickly into ˚ghting themﬂ!7I had once also asked Jawl˜n˛ about the Free Syrian Army after the ﬁJabhahﬂ treated their wealth and weapons as hal˜l in Idlib, ﬁAre you making takf˛r of them?ﬂ He replied, ﬁYes.ﬂ8 I was not astonished at all, since we would all make takf˛r of the murtadd Free Syrian Army in his gatherings. I told him, ﬁWhy is it then, that you condemn the Islamic State for its policies and how the Islamic State handled 7 Editor™s Note: Ahr˜r ash-Sh˜m were ﬁthe Sahw˜t of the future,ﬂ but he cooperated with them against the Islamic State!8 Editor™s Note: ˝is is from the betrayals of Jawl˜n˚. He makes takf˚r of the Free Syrian Army but gathers with the factions including the Free Syrian Army to plan betrayal and war against the Islamic State! ˝en he and his senior leaders Œ such as Ahmad Zakk˛r, Ab˛ M˜riyah al-Har˜r˚, Hammawdah and others Œ cooperate with the apostate Free Syrian Army against the Islamic State!Hayy˜n˛, Jazarah, and the rest of the FSA brigades? ˇe other day you condemned it and claimed that this policy is the reason for the ˚tnah and the war of the factions in Halab, Idlib, Ham˜h as well as Latakia and today you yourselves are doing the same thing.ﬂDespite all these discussions occurring amongst the leaders, their reality opposes these statements of theirs that they do not announce. ˇis is only due to their ambiguity, hesitation, and compromise, until the slogans of ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ in the arena became super˚cial and inconsistent having no true meaning.Where is the responsibility of da™wah, clari˚cation of truth, and manifesting it amongst the people? Are we not supposed to call the people to the correct creed and to liberate the Earth from the reign of taw˜gh˛t? Isn™t the liberation of the hearts and the liberation of the people from shirk our obligation rather than deluding, using, and exploiting them for purposes and interests all so that we can compromise! ˇis, by misguiding them and being silent about the falsehood they are upon and with ˆattery! ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ thinks that the result of this policy is that they control the di˝erent sides in the arena of Sh˜m but the days will prove the opposite. ˇe precursors of these matters might already have appeared clearly by the announcement of ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ and likewise by the Jabhah™s melting and vanishing in eastern Gh˙tah and south of the capital. ˇe events of Afghanistan after the end of the war against the Russians are not hidden from anybody who possesses insight and reason.D˜biq: Did anyone share the views you held? Is there anyone over there who reached the same conclusion?Abˆ Sam˙r: Yes, certainly and I will tell you what I saw before making hijrah to the Islamic State. When I had left the Jawl˜n˛ front and then followed up on the events, I was resolved to return to the ranks of the Islamic State because of what I had seen and heard and because I am a son of the Islamic State. At that point, I went to address two persons, in order to disavow myself unto Allah and to FSA  secularistsand their supporters76INTERVIEWconvey my witness account and what I myself experienced after I had left the Jawl˜n˛ front. I went to meet two advisors and leaders of ﬁJabhat an-Nusrah.ﬂ One of them Œ as is well-known amongst ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ Œ is the delegate of Ayman adh-Dhaw˜hir˛. He is the one who speaks and transmits to Dhaw˜hir˛ the course of events in the Sh˜m˛ arena. When I sat down with him in a meeting that took about 10 hours, I explained to him the history and deeds of Jawl˜n˛, the sh˙r˜ council, and my opinion about the arena.He said to me, ﬁWell, my respected brother, we know more than what you have said and we have gathered more of these grave matters than you.ﬂ So I was shocked! He said, ﬁYes, I have with me more than what you mentioned.ﬂ I told him, ﬁSubh˜nall˜h! On Judgment Day, this will be a proof against you! Well, these words that you say, what must you do concerning them? I have with me history, facts, and stories that took place between me and Jawl˜n˛, his sh˙r˜ council, the arena, and my opinion on it, and have made a decision and settled my a˝air while you are saying that you know more of it than me, so what do think you should do?ﬂ He said, ﬁCurrently we are a reconciliatory board, we proceed to ˚x the matters you mentioned and we work on reforming this body.ﬂ I told him, ﬁSubh˜nall˜h! Is this a ‚coat hanger™ on which you hang your stance? Because I believe that a reformer should no doubt have a time frame or multi-stage project on which he bases that there will be reform or change. So do you see any change? Do you see yourself as able to bring about change?ﬂWhat had made me more intense was him mentioning to me the story of the announcement of the ﬁemirateﬂ that Jawl˜n˛ made in his famous speech in Idlib. He did not consult with anyone in the ˚rst place, neither with Dhaw˜hir˛™s delegate nor with those whom he trusts of those present with him. Jawl˜n˛ had called both Dhaw˜hir˛™s delegate and al-Muhaysin˛ to be present for this speech which he was going to read and mention in it ﬁsomething greatﬂ! ˇey did not know what this great thing was and Dhaw˜hir˛™s delegate told me word for word, ﬁJawl˜n˛ wanted to take advantage of me and make me read a speech in which I spoke of establishing an emirate and the like.ﬂ ˇen he said, ﬁI was surprised by this because he had not consulted me and had not spoken to me about this topic before.ﬂ But al-Muhaysin˛, who is not a member of ﬁJabhat an-Nusrah,ﬂ nor does he have a bay™ah to ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ in the ˚rst place, went to speak and make a speech that was accompanied by intense enthusiasm and shouts of takb˛r due to the proclamation of their alleged ﬁIslamic emirate.ﬂI told him, ﬁHow can you say that you are a part of reform and that you will proceed to reform, while you are not even consulted on this great matter?! How will you bring about change with this denial of your very presence?ﬂ He said, ﬁAllah™s help is sought, we are trying to bring about reform.ﬂ He said this with a tone of submission and defeat. So I told him, ﬁMy noble brother, I ask you for the sake of Allah; why don™t you notify Dhaw˜hir˛ and inform him of this reality?ﬂ He replied, ﬁWho said that I have not informed him?ﬂˇen I said, ﬁAll˜hu akbar! What was his response?ﬂ ˇen he acknowledged to me that Dhaw˜hir˛ ﬁdoes not have the power to do anythingﬂ! ˇereupon I made takb˛r, prostrated to Allah in gratitude, and said, ﬁSubh˜nall˜h, if Dhaw˜hir˛ has no control, then what kind of an organization is he leading! All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the creation! I am innocent of an organization whose leadership has no control over it!ﬂ ˇus my conviction in my abandonment of the ﬁJabhahﬂ increased. It is nothing more than a bunch of gang neighborhoods. Every leader has his own neighborhood. And this is the testimony of Ayman Dhaw˜hir˛™s delegate to me.9D˜biq: To conclude, we ask Allah to make this testimony something that guides those who remained in the Sahwah Coalition towards sincere repentance and to make this testimony in your scale of good deeds. May Allah reward you with good.9 Editor™s Note: As for the second man whose story the brother mentioned, then he also was a member of Jawl˜n˚™s sh˛r˜ council; he repented from what he was upon before and joined the Islamic State. He pronounced takf˚r upon Jawl˜n˚ for a number of matters that he himself witnessed before leaving him. In addition, he mentioned that Jawl˜n˚ proposed in front of him a plan to attack the city of ar-Raqqah from the direction of al-B˜diyah in simultaneity with the beginning of the crusader campaign against the Islamic State in order to exploit the Islamic State™s preoccupation with the new war!7777ARTICLEA claimant of ﬁIslamﬂvoting in kufr˛ elections78INTERVIEW7979ARTICLEThe murtadd˛n of the ﬁN˚rﬂ party in the Egyptian parliament

All praise is due to Allah. May blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah, and upon his family, companions, and followers. As for what proceeds:˜e most shaming event of 1436 Œ and only Allah knows best Œ will be recorded in history as one without precedence, except in the records of hoaxes and legends. Searching through these chronicles, one ˚nds the closest precedent to be the myth of ﬁPope Joan,ﬂ a woman who supposedly fooled the pagan church into electing her as pope while disguising herself as a man. She allegedly succeeded in duping and ruling the cross-worshippers for years before being exposed and dying shortly thereafter–˜e closest other precedent would be that of the ﬁhidden im˛msﬂ of some apostate sects including the R˛˚dah who believe in the occultation of Muhammad al-‚Askar˝, the Ism˛™˝liyyah who believe in the occultation of Muhammad Ibn Ism˛™˝l Ibn Ja™far as-S˛diq, and the Druze who believe in the occultation of ﬁal-H˛kim bi Amrill˛hﬂ al-‚Ubayd˝. Some of their sects even believe in reincarnations of the so-called ﬁhidden im˛mﬂ or in deputies acting on his behalf–Yes, these are the closest precedents for the great shaming event, the hoax of Akhtar Mans˙r, a man close to and favored by the Pakistani ﬁInter-Services Intelligenceﬂ (ISI) and who for years has ruled the expired ﬁIslamic Emirate of Afghanistanﬂ in the name of the departed Mull˛ Muhammad ‚Umar. And while taking advantage of Mull˛ ‚Umar™s death, Akhtar released statements Œ both in the name of Mull˛ ‚Umar and the ﬁemirateﬂ Œ in support of national reconciliation with the apostate Afghan puppet regime, normalization of relations with the apostates of the Pakistani regime and army, glori˚cation of various Arab and non-Arab taw˛gh˝t including the American slaves Hamad Al ˜ani and Tamim Al ˜ani of Qatar, and declaring the most evil enemy of Islam Œ the Safaw˝ regime of Iran Œ a Muslim state! He released statements upholding the principles of the United Nations, international conventions, nationalism, ﬁmodernism,ﬂ and paci˚sm, as well as statements disavowing both oˆensive and defensive jih˛d except for a nationalist Afghani war against the American occupational forces. He released statements supporting the legality and authority of the democratic t˛gh˙t elections in Egypt and their electoral results. He released statements declaring the R˛˚dah to be Muslims, even condemning attacks against the R˛˚dah of Afghanistan.1 And through their hold on the Taliban, he and his closest accomplices Œ for the sake of personal gains and severe deviances and in the name of the deceased Mull˛ ‚Umar Œ waged war against the Khil˛fah that ruled by the Shar˝™ah and that practiced wal˛™ and bar˛™ while their Taliban ﬁemirateﬂ forcefully resisted the clear-cut and de˚nite obligations of wal˛™ and bar˛™. And thus, according to Akhtar and his accomplices™ words and deeds, the R˛˚dah and taw˛gh˝t are their ﬁMuslim brothersﬂ whom they honor, while the Islamic State™s leaders and soldiers are ﬁKhaw˛rijﬂ against whom they wage war–˜roughout this period, the various Q˛™idah branches claimed that they could not pledge allegiance to the Qurash˝ Khal˝fah Ab˙ Bakr al-Baghd˛d˝ (ha˚dhahull˛h) because Mull˛ ‚Umar was their ﬁutmost im˛m,ﬂ after years of Q˛™idah leaders stating that Mull˛ ‚Umar was not a khal˝fah but a bounded leader of a regional emirate2. ˜is was accompanied by years of the Taliban releasing statements in rejection of any mission outside of Afghanistan.1 ˜e statements can be found on the Taliban™s o˚cial website. A large selection of them were compiled and referenced in an article titled ﬁF˛dihat ash-Sh˛m wa Kasr al-Asn˛mﬂ (ﬁ˜e Sh˛m˝ Exposé and the Breaking of the Idolsﬂ) by Ab˙ Maysarah ash-Sh˛m˝.2 ˜is was explicitly stated by ‚Atiyyatull˛h al-L˝b˝. It was also explicitly stated by Dhaw˛hir˝ and an-Nadh˛r˝, but it is hizbiyyah that blinds the hearts!FOREWORDThe Taliban walk hand-in-handwith the taw˜gh˛t5dabiqMuj˛hid˝n in Khur˛s˛n then began to openly reject the claim that Mull˛ ‚Umar was still alive, many of them believing he had died almost fourteen years ago, shortly after the start of the American invasion of Afghanistan in ﬁlate 2001.ﬂ More and more truthful ˚ghters abandoned the ranks of Akhtar™s Taliban and pledged allegiance to the Khil˛fah, as others began to put pressure on the Taliban leadership for evidence of Mull˛ ‚Umar™s life. ˜e Taliban released another written statement fabricated with a nationalist tone and dialect in the name of the deceased Mull˛ ‚Umar, congratulating the Ummah on Eid al-Fitr and supporting the national Afghan reconciliation with the apostate regime! Pressure magni˚ed even from Akhtar™s supporters in the Pakistani and Afghani intelligence, until he and his accomplices admitted to Mull˛ ‚Umar™s death. ˜e political oˇce of the Taliban ﬁemirateﬂ then announced that Mull˛ ‚Umar had passed away speci˚cally on ﬁ23 April 2013.ﬂ ˜ereafter Muhammad Tayyib ˘gh˛ Œ the head of the political oˇce and formerly one of the closest men to Mull˛ ‚Umar Œ announced his resignation and declared that he considers the concealment of Mull˛ ‚Umar™s death for a period of ﬁtwo and a half yearsﬂ to be a ﬁhistorical mistake.ﬂ ˜is was followed by a statement from Zabihullah Mujahid (oˇcial spokesman of the Taliban ﬁemirateﬂ), in which he admitted to their covering up of Mull˛ ‚Umar™s death since ﬁ23 April 2013.ﬂAccordingly, Mull˛ ‚Umar had passed away at least more than a year before the announcement of the Khil˛fah and very shortly after the Islamic State™s oˇcial expansion into Sh˛m, that is assuming he hadn™t passed away years before– So what did al-Q˛™idah and its partisans do in response to this hoax? Did they repent and join the ranks of the Khil˛fah? No– Al-Q˛™idah™s supporters from amongst those claiming ﬁscholarshipﬂ wrote treatises to justify the concealment of Mull˛ ‚Umar™s death, not quoting the Qur™˛n and the Sunnah, but the books of history about the khalaf (the generations after the Salaf) full of unveri˚able events whose personalities are not even examples for the Ummah! ˜e few examples from the Salaf they quoted and distorted involved concealment of a leader™s death only for a short time and only from a small part of the Muslim army engaged in battle, not for months and years and certainly not from the entire Ummah!˜e hizb˝ (partisan) ﬁscholarsﬂ then exaggerated the ruling on lying for the sake of war and reconciliation to include lying open-endedly to the worldwide Muslim Ummah in its entirety from the far East to the distant West including all its scholars, leaders, ˚ghters, and men, all for the sake of some loosely-de˚ned ﬁmaslahah.ﬂ ˜ey even permitted speech to be fabricated in the name of a dead man only to prevent the uni˚cation of the Ummah under the obligation of Khil˛fah and to bind it through chains of taql˝d (blind following) to the evil of hizbiyyah (partisanship)! Worse yet, these ﬁscholarsﬂ have thereby paved the way for the masses to deny anything proclaimed to them, as this deviant prmeans anything could be an unending lie to the entire Ummah for the sake of hizbiyyah. And who knows, perhaps some of the ignorant masses will come out and allege that Mull˛ ‚Umar is still alive, not dead, and then there will be a new ﬁoccultationﬂ claim added to those of the R˛˚dah and B˛tiniyyah–˜en suddenly Dhaw˛hir˝ Œ who disappeared for almost a year, since ﬁ3 September 2014ﬂ Œ came out and pledged allegiance to the liar Akhtar Mans˙r! ˜is was despite Akhtar™s authority being heavily disputed by large divisions of the Taliban, including those headed by Mull˛ ‚Umar™s son and brother, as well as those parties opposing Akhtar™s plans for national reconciliation and international normalization.

Turkey has remained steadfast in its ethical and humanitarian position towards our people and our revolution. ˜is wise and responsible position has made Turkey the most important ally of the Syrian revolution and has opened up new avenues of common interests between two peoples, whether on the internal or regional fronts. ˜e latest avenue of common interests is standing up to Daesh. Daesh has proven to be the biggest disaster to have befallen the revolution as well as being a real threat to Turkey™s security and stability. ˜e sectarian policies of Bashar Assad and the foolish policies of Daesh have turned Syria into an arena for international oxy wars. ˜is has eˆected the security of the allies of the Syrian people. While maintaining the principled position on rejecting of foreign dictates and tutelage, there is now a reality that must be dealt with in accordance with the principles of the common good and the long-term interests of the country as a whole.ﬂﬁBased on the comprehensive vision of Ahrar Al-Sham Islamic Movement towards the internal and regional scene, and acting in accordance with the interests of the Syrian people and its allies in any political or military matter, and believing strongly in the need for Sunni solidarity in the face of the Iranian threat, we believe that the announcement of Turkey™s intention to establish a safe zone in the north of Syria is a matter that serves the interest of the Syrian people. ˜e safe zone will have positive repercussions on the humanitarian, political and military levels, the bene˚ts of which will be felt by both countries. ˜e safe zone is also a necessary measure to bolster Turkey™s national security and to stop in its tracks terrorist or secessionist plans by Daesh and the PKK. – ˜e safe zone in the north of Syria will help refugees return to their homes and the plots of the enemies of the revolution to be foiled. Ahrar al-Sham Islamic Movement therefore fully supports the safe zone with the help of Turkey and the political and military cooperation of Armed Revolutionary Groups. We take this opportunity to stress the unbreakable bond and the common destiny of the Syrian and the Turkish peoples and underscore the need for the strategic ties with Turkey to become the cornerstone for a common approach to tackling current and future challenges.ﬂ4˜ereby, ﬁAhr˛r ash-Sh˛mﬂ has extended its hand egime and army of Turkey and nominated itself to be their agents in Syria. So will the jih˛d claimants in the Jawl˛n˝ front repent from apostasy and pronounce bar˛™ah from their closest ally whom their leaders had once considered ﬁthe Sahw˛t of the futureﬂ? Or will the slippery slope of ﬁexcusesﬂ dictated by hizbiyyah continue to make them fall until they ˚ght under the banner of the greatest ˚tnah Œ al-Mas˝h ad-Dajj˛l Œ for the sake of leadership, partisanship, and deviance?5We ask Allah to support the muj˛hid˝n of the Islamic State against the agents of the taw˛gh˝t and the crusaders until the banner of the Khil˛fah is raised high above Istanbul and Vatican City.4 Note that in the statements of the various Sahwah factions they claim to care for the people of Sh˛m while knowing that the airstrikes plotted to form the Turkish ﬁsafe zoneﬂ will target the muj˛hid˝n of the Khil˛fah, the harshest warriors against the Nusayr˝ forces. ˜ese factions also use the atheist PKK as an excuse to ˆght under the banner of the Tur-kish t˛gh˙t but forget that they themselves had all forged truces and agreements with the apostate PKK in Halab, some of these agreements even entailing the sharing of power to administer PKK-controlled territories. ˜e most famous agreements in Halab with the PKK were signed by the Ahl ash-Sh˛m Operations Room and the Sh˛miyyah Front. ˜ese agreements included ﬁJaysh al-Muj˛hid˝nﬂ and ﬁAhr˛r ash-Sh˛mﬂ as members. If they were truly worried about the atheist PKK as they now claim, then rather than signing truces with them, they would have waged war against them like the Islamic State has done.5 More recently, Robert Ford (former US ambassador to Syria) wrote an article titled ﬁYes, Talk with Syria™s Ahrar al-Sham,ﬂ in which he strongly proposed direct US cooperation with ﬁAhr˛r ash-Sh˛mﬂ against the Islamic State, aˇer almost two years of indirect cooper-ation through the taw˛gh˝t. ˜is was followed by an article in the ﬁDaily Beastﬂ titled ﬁDeal with Devils Œ Petraeus: Use Al Qaeda Fighters to Beat ISIS,ﬂ in which the idea of David Petraeus (former commanding general of the crusaders in Iraq and co-founder of the Iraqi Sahwah) in cooperating with the Jawl˛n˝ front against the Islamic State was publicized. ˜is was followed by the lying Ab˙ ‚Abdill˛h ash-Sh˛m˝ justifying his cooperation with the various Sahw˛t of Turkey, America, and the Gulf taw˛gh˝t based on the claim one could not pronounce takf˝r upon these factions due to excuses he fabricated for the Sahw˛t regard-ing their cooperation with the crusaders and apostates! He then lied and claimed that the Islamic State had itself ﬁcooperatedﬂ with Turkey and he used as his ﬁproofﬂ the prisoner exchange in which 46 Turkish prisoners were exchanged for almost 200 muh˛jir˝n! Is this ﬁcooperationﬂ or fulfulling the obligation of striving for the release of Muslim prisoners! He made his shameful lie knowing very well that the apostate Turkish regime and army are part of NATO and the American-led crusade against the Islamic State and that Turkey partakes in the imprisonment of muh˛jir˝n and together with America strikes positions of the Islamic State in Halab for the sake of the Sahw˛t allied to the Jawl˛n˝ front, sometimes even positions in favor of the Jawl˛n˝ front itself! One can only say to him, ﬁIf you are shameless, then do as you pleaseﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˛r˝ from Ab˙ Mas™˙d]. Ash-Sh˛m˝ can lie as much as he pleases, but the truth is too clear. When will the Sahwah sheep wake up and realize they are ultimately serving the interests of the crusaders?10ARTICLEAllah revealed the Qur™˛n and the Sunnah to our Prophet Muhammad so that mankind would study them and practice them. ˜is was the religion of Islam that was conveyed by the Messenger  to his Companions , which they conveyed to the generations thereafter. Islam was preserved in the Qur™˛n and the Sunnah, and the Sunnah was preserved in the books of had˝th. If a Muslim with understanding of the Arabic language picked up the Qur™˛n, or Sah˝h al-Bukh˛r˝, or Sah˝h Muslim, he would not require encyclopedic knowledge to be able to understand and practice his religion overall, for learning its basics was facilitated for him by Allah . He made tawh˝d and ˝m˛n from the simplest matters that any layman could understand. Similarly is the case of many de˚nite rulings of Islam, including the obligation to unite in one body, appoint a single leader, and hear and obey him, as the proofs in the Shar˝™ah and the evidences inside the creation are so many that a person with a sound ˚trah, even if he were mostly ignorant, would not be able to overlook this obligation.{And hold ˚rmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided} [˘l ‚Imr˛n: 103]. ˜e Prophet said, ﬁWhoever dies while not having a bay™ah around his neck dies a death of j˛hiliyyahﬂ [Reported by Muslim from Ibn ‚Umar]. And the explicit proofs and implicit evidences for these fundamentals are very many; whoever seeks them will ˚nd them easily.1 Yet Muslims today are discouraged by the so-called ﬁSalaf˝ﬂ or even ﬁSalaf˝ Jih˛d˝ﬂ claimants from approaching the Qur™˛n and the Sunnah without blinding goggles limiting them to the desires of contemporary ﬁscholarsﬂ from amongst those supporting the taw˛gh˝t or those sitting back amongst their women in the shades of the taw˛gh˝t. Was this deviant intermediary a condition for understanding the religion before? Was it ever a prerequisite for jam˛™ah?Know that it is undeniably a trait of the people of deviance to remain divided without having a single im˛m. For this reason, Ahlus-Sunnah are called Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jam˛™ah, meaning they follow the Sunnah and adhere to the Muslim body embodied in the khil˛fah and its im˛m while distancing themselves from the deviant sects and the mutinous parties. As for contemporary ﬁAhlus-Sunnah,ﬂ then they replaced the concept of Jam˛™ah with a deviant interpretation of sh˙r˛ more akin to democracy ballot boxes than the sh˙r˛ of the Khulaf˛™ ar-R˛shid˝n.Im˛m Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˛b said, ﬁ˜ese are matters in which the kit˛b˝ and illiterate people of the J˛hiliyyah opposed Allah™s Messenger . ˜e Muslim cannot aˆord to be ignorant of these matters, for by the opposite of good, good becomes manifest. And through the opposite of matters, matters become distinct – ˜e second of these matters [after major shirk] is that they are divided about their religion, as Allah  said, {But 1 See, for example, ﬁKit˛b al-Ahk˛mﬂ of al-Bukh˛r˝ and ﬁKit˛b al-Im˛rahﬂ of Muslim.˜e Evil Of Division And Taql˜d11dabiqthe people divided their religion among them into sects Œ each faction, in what it has, rejoicing} [Al-Mu™min˙n: 53]. ˜ey are also divided about their duny˛ and they consider this good. So he came with unity regarding the religion with Allah™s statement, {He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon N˙h and that which We have revealed to you, and what We enjoined upon Ibr˛h˝m and Ms˛ Œ to establish the religion and not be divided therein} [Ash-Sh˙r˛: 13]. Allah  also said, {Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects Œ you have nothing to do with them} [Al-An™˛m: 159]. He also prohibited us from being like them with Allah™s statement, {And do not be like the ones who became divided and diˆered after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment} [˘l ‚Imr˛n: 105]. He also prohibited us from dividing about the duny˛ with Allah™s statement, {And hold ˚rmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided} [˘l ‚Imr˛n: 103]. ˜e third of these matters is that they considered disobeying the person in authority and refusing to yield to him a virtue. ˜ey considered hearing and obeying him humiliation and disgrace. Allah™s Messenger opposed them and ordered his companions to be patient with the injustices of the rulers2. He ordered them to hear and obey them and give them sincere advice. He was severe about this, expressed it, and repeated it. ˜ese three matters he gathered together in the had˝th reported by al-Bukh˛r˝ and Muslim, ‚Allah is pleased with three matters for you, that you worship Him and not associate anything with Him in worship, that you hold to the rope of Allah together and not divide, and that you sincerely advise those whom Allah gives authority over you.™ No calamity occurred in the people™s religion and duny˛ except by violation of these three principles or some of themﬂ [Mas˛™il al-J˛hiliyyah].He also said, ﬁFrom the most amazing things and greatest signs showing the power of Allah are six principles that He  made very clear more so than what the doubtful people think. ˜ereafter, many of the ‚intelligent™ people of the world and ‚wise™ men of mankind erred about these principles, except for a very few. – ˜e second principle [after the obligation of tawh˝d and prohibition of shirk] is that Allah ordered with unity regarding the religion and prohibited division within it. Allah clari˚ed this with clear and conclusive evidence that the laymen can understand. He prohibited us from being like those who divided before us and thus were destroyed. He also mentioned that He ordered the Messengers with unity regarding the religion and 2 He refers to Muslim rulers who rule by the Shar˝™ah but commit injustices, not rulers who apostatize by legislating, executing, or judging by manmade laws, nor rulers who have wal˛™ to the crusaders against the Muslims.prohibited them from division within it. What makes this clearer is what the Sunnah came with of amazing teachings in this regards. ˜en the matter changed until division over the fundamentals and branches of the religion became ‚knowledge™ and ‚˚qh of the religion™! And then no one called to the obligation to unite regarding the religion except for a ‚zind˝q™ or ‚madman™! ˜e third principle is that the ful˚llment of unity is by hearing and obeying he who has been granted authority over us even if he might be an Ethiopian slave. Allah clari˚ed this prevalently and suˇciently through various kinds of shar™˝ and qadar˝ evidences. It then became the fundamental not known to most of the claimants of knowledge. What then of acting in accordance with this matter!ﬂ [Six Great Bene˚cial Fundamentals].And although jam˛™ah is from the most obvious of obligations with even the ˚trah of many animals being inclined to it, the modern claimants of Islam argue that it is better for the Ummah to have religious and political pluralism! ˜ey prefer that Ahlus-Sunnah tolerate the various sects of bid™ah and even apostasy who claim to belong to the Muslim Ummah. ˜ey also wish that Ahlus-Sunnah would permit the existence of deviant, warring, and sel˚sh political parties and militant factions on the liberated Muslim lands! ˜ey made taql˝d (blind following) of their partisan, evil ﬁscholarsﬂ an essential aspect of ﬁreligion.ﬂ And through this, they propagated the ﬁvirtueﬂ of division and denounced the ﬁevilﬂ of jam˛™ah in their campaign against the revived body of Islam, the Khil˛fah. How wicked are the deviant parties and corrupt ﬁscholarsﬂ!˜erefore know Œ may Allah have mercy upon you Œ that the major basis for the religions of the J˛hiliyyah was taql˝d. After Im˛m Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˛b mentioned the ˚rst three aspects of their religion (shirk, religious division, and political disunity), he said, ﬁ˜e fourth matter is that their religion is based upon principles, the greatest of which is taql˝d. It is the major principle for all the kuˆ˛r, the ˚rst of them and last of them, as Allah  said, {And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city exsaid, ﬁIndeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, followingﬂ} [Az-Zukhruf: 23]. He  also said, {And when it is said to them, ﬁFollow what Allah has revealed,ﬂ they say, ﬁRather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers.ﬂ Even if Shayt˛n was inviting them to the punishment of Hell˚re?} [Luqm˛n: 21]. So he came to them with Allah™s statement, {Say, ﬁI only advise you of one thing Œ that you stand for Allah, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.ﬂ ˜ere is not in your companion any madness. 12ARTICLEHe is only a warner to you before a severe punishment} [Saba™: 46] and Allah™s statement, {Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember} [Al-A™r˛f: 3]ﬂ [Mas˛™il al-J˛hiliyyah].He thereafter goes on detailing various kinds of taql˝d that the people of J˛hiliyyah practiced. He said, ﬁFrom their biggest principles is to be dazzled by the majority. ˜ey use this as evidence to claim something is correct. ˜ey also claim something is false by its strangeness and lack of followers. So he came to them with the opposite of such. Allah clari˚ed it in more than one place in the Qur™˛n.3 ˜ey also use the people of the past as proof, as described in Allah™s statement {[Fir™awn] said, ﬁ˜en what is the case of the former generations?ﬂ} [T˛h˛: 51]. {ﬁWe have not heard of this among our forefathersﬂ} [Al-Mu™min˙n: 24]. ˜ey also use as proof a people who were given strength in intellect, feats, kingship, wealth, and honor. Allah rejected this by His statement, {And We had certainly established them in such as We have not established you, and We made for them hearing and vision and hearts. But their hearing and vision and hearts availed them not from anything when they were rejecting the signs of Allah; and they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule} [Al-Ahq˛f: 26]. ˜ey also claim something is false due to no one following it except the weak. {ﬁShould we believe you while you are followed by the lowest [class of people]?ﬂ} [Ash-Shu™ar˛: 111], {ﬁIs it these whom Allah has favored among us?ﬂ} [Al-An™˛m: 3 For example, {And even if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead spoke to them and We gathered together everything in front of them, they would not believe unless Allah should will. But most of them are ignorant} [Al-An™˛m: 111].53]. So Allah responded with His statement, {Is not Allah most knowing of those who are grateful?} [Al-An™˛m: 53]. ˜ey follow the sinful scholars and worshippers. So he  came to them with Allah™s statement, {O you who have believed, indeed many of the scholars and the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly and avert them from the way of Allah} [At-Tawbah: 34] and with Allah™s statement, {ﬁDo not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the wayﬂ} [Al-M˛™idah: 77]. ˜ey also claim the religion is false due to its small amount of followers and their lack of intellect, as in their statement {ﬁsimple-mindedﬂ} [H˙d: 27]. ˜ey use as evidence incorrect qiy˛s, as in their statement, {ﬁYou are not but men like usﬂ} [Ibr˛h˝m: 10]. ˜ey also reject correct qiy˛s.4  What links this matter to the former is that they do not understand the diˆerence between the inclusive and the distinctive. ˜ey go to extremes in their love and imitation of the scholars and righteous, as described in Allah™s statement, {O People of the Book, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth} [An-Nis˛™: 171]. All the preceding is based upon a principle of negation and aˇrmation: ˜ey follow their desires and doubts and abandon what the Messengers came withﬂ [Points 5-14 of ﬁMas˛™il al-J˛hiliyyahﬂ].Know also that the taql˝d of the j˛hil˝ people was not towards pious scholars or scholarly worshippers, but 4 ˜ey rejected many of the logical proofs for ul˙hiyyah and resurrection, for example, {And We have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest and loˇy palm trees having fruit arranged in layers Œ as provision for the servants, and We have given life thereby to a dead land. ˜us is the resurrection} [Q˛f: 9-11].13dabiqrather, as Im˛m Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˛b said, ﬁ˜eir religious leaders were either corrupt scholars or ignorant worshippers, as described in Allah™s statement, {A party of them used to hear the words of Allah and then distort the Tawr˛h after they had understood it while they were knowing} [Al-Baqarah: 75] to His statement, {And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Book except in wishful thinking, but they are only assuming} [Al-Baqarah: 78]ﬂ [Mas˛™il al-J˛hiliyyah].He also described this condition by saying, ﬁ˜e fourth principle is clarifying what knowledge and ˚qh is, who the scholars and fuqah˛™ are, and who attempts to resemble them but is not truly from them. Allah  has clari˚ed this principle in S˙rat al-Baqarah in His description of Ban˝ Isr˛™˝l [Al-Baqarah: 40-121]. What makes this clearer is what the Sunnah clari˚ed on this matter with many clear and apparent words that the most simple layman can grasp easily. ˜is principle then became the strangest of matters. ‚Knowledge™ and ‚˚qh™ became bid™ah and deviation; the ‚best™ thing they could do is confuse the truth with falsehood for others. Now no one utters the knowledge that Allah  obligated upon the creation and praised except a ‚zind˝q™ or ‚madman™! And the person who denounces it, holds enmity towards it, authors warnings against and condemnations of it, became the ‚faq˝h™ and ‚scholar™! ˜e ˚fth principle is that Allah clari˚ed who His awliy˛™ are, and made them distinct from those who attempt to resemble them from amongst His hypocritical and corrupt enemies. One ˛yah in S˙rat ˘l ‚Imr˛n is suˇcient in clarifying this, {Say, ﬁIf you should love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love youﬂ} [˘l ‚Imr˛n: 31], and one ˛yah in S˙rat al-M˛™idah, {O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion Œ Allah will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him who are humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive for the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic} [Al-M˛™idah: 51], and ˛y˛t in S˙rat Y˙nus, {Unquestionably, there will be no fear for the allies of Allah, nor will they grieve. ˜ey are those who believed and were fearing Allah} [Y˙nus: 62-63]. ˜en Œ according to the claimants of knowledge who claim to be guides for the creation and preservers of the Shar˝™ah Œ the matter became that the awliy˛™ must abandon following the Messengers, and whoever follows the Messenger is not from the awliy˛. ˜ey must also abandon jih˛d, and whoever performs jih˛d is not from them. ˜ey must also abandon ˝m˛n and taqw˛, and whoever commits to ˝m˛n and taqw˛ is not from them. Our Lord, we ask You forgiveness and wellness. You are the hearer of du™˛™ﬂ [Six Great Bene˚cial Fundamentals].And similarly the claimants of Islam today require that Muslims blindly follow corrupt scholars and ignorant worshippers and reject the obligation of jam˛™ah otherwise they are ﬁKhaw˛rijﬂ! ˜ey ask the Muslims to follow those ﬁscholarsﬂ who abandoned jih˛d in an era where jih˛d is fard ‚ayn. ˜ey ask the Muslims to follow those ﬁscholarsﬂ who are silent about the evils of rulers who are taw˛gh˝t not merely tyrannical. ˜ey even ask the Muslims to follow those ﬁscholarsﬂ who call to deviance and apostasy and who side with the crusaders and apostates against the Muslims! Is it not the obligation to hate these ﬁscholarsﬂ for Allah™s sake and boycott them until they repent?Shaykhul-Isl˛m Ibn Taymiyyah said, ﬁ˜e comprehensive hijrah is to boycott sins and the people of sin, as well as the callers to bid™ah, the f˛siq people, those who socialize with any of these people or aid them in their sin, and those who abandon jih˛d, the deed without which there is no good for the people, as he should be punished by boycott because he does not help the Muslims in piety and righteousness. So the fornicators, the sodomites, the abandoners of jih˛d, the people of bid™ah, and the drunkards, these people and the mingling with them is harmful for the religion of Islam. ˜ere is no cooperation from them not upon righteousness nor upon piety. Whoever does not boycott them has abandoned a commanded deed and committed a censured actionﬂ [Majm˙™ al-Fat˛w˛].Yes, those who abandon jih˛d are akin to the fornicators, the sodomites, and the drunkards, and yet the claimants of Islam request the muj˛hid˝n to blindly follow these sinful ﬁscholars,ﬂ those who prefer to sit in the shades of the taw˛gh˝t and crusaders rather than perform jih˛d against the kuˆ˛r–As for those ﬁscholarsﬂ who are merely silent about the taw˛gh˝t, then they are worse than the sinners who commit the severest of sins.Ibnul-Qayyim said, ﬁ˜ose who have a background with what Allah sent His Messenger  and with what his Companions were upon realize that most of those famous for their religiosity are actually the least religious. All˛hulmusta™˛n. What religion and what good are in a person who sees Allah™s sanctuary violated, His limits disregarded, His religion abandoned, and the Sunnah of His Messenger  turned away from, while his heart is cool and tongue is silent? He is a mute devil just as the one who speaks with falsehood is a speaking devil. Is the calamity of the religion from anyone but these who if their food and positions are safe, then they care not what happens to 14ARTICLEthe religion? ˜e best of them is he who tries to be sad and barely opens his mouth. If he were to be disputed over something that pains him of his honor or wealth, he would exert, strive, and use all three levels of denunciation to the best of his ability. ˜ese people, in addition to them falling from the eye of Allah and Allah hating them, have been uny˛ with the gr while not realizing it, that is the death of the heart, because the more the heart is alive, the stronger the anger for Allah and His Messenger is and the more complete the rush to support the religion isﬂ [I™l˛m al-Muwaqqi™˝n].He also said, ﬁ˜e religion is not merely abandoning the open sins, rather, in addition to that, it is carrying out the orders loved by Allah. Most of those claiming to be religious disregard from the religion everything except what the laymen have common with them. As for jih˛d, commanding the good, forbidding the evil, being sincere towards Allah and His Messenger, sincerely advising His slaves, and supporting Allah, His Messenger, His religion, and His book, then these deeds do not come to their mind, never mind wanting to do them, never mind actually doing them. ˜e least religious of people and the most hated by Allah are those who abandon these deeds even if they have zuhd towards all the Duny˛. It is rare that you ˚nd one of them having his face change and turn red for Allah™s sake, get angry for His sanctuary, and exert himself in support of His religion. ˜e people of major sins are better in Allah™s sight than these peopleﬂ [‚Uddat as-S˛bir˝n].Accordingly, how can one take as role models the eˆeminate males Œ the abandoners of jih˛d? Or the mute devils silent about the taw˛gh˝t, in whose shade they rest with their wives? If it is wrong in general to blindly follow a pious scholar or knowledgeable worshipper, is it not more wrong to follow the sinful devils! Why then does the Muslim not turn to the basic teachings of the Qur™˛n and the Sunnah and apply them as they should be applied without making these ﬁscholarsﬂ a barrier from him joining the Jam˛™ah of the Muslims, the Khil˛fah?Im˛m Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˛b said, ﬁ˜e sixth principle is to reject the doubt fabricated by Shayt˛n to make the people abandon the Qur™˛n and Sunnah and follow the divided and inconsistent opinions and desires. ˜is doubt is the claim that the Qur™˛n and Sunnah cannot be understood except by an absolute mujtahid. And the mujtahid according to them is the person described with so many traits, which perhaps do not exist altogether in Ab˙ Bakr and ‚Umar ! And if the person is not so, then it is ‚undoubtedly™ and ‚unquestionably™ a ‚mandatory obligation™ for him to turn away from the Qur™˛n and Sunnah! As for the person who seeks guidance from the Qur™˛n and Sunnah, then he is either a ‚zind˝q™ or ‚madman™ due to the diˇculty in understanding them! Glory and praise be to Allah! Allah  greatly and clearly refuted this accursed doubt from numerous angles through the Shar˝™ah, the Qadar, the creation, and the command, until it reached the level of essential, common knowledge, but most of the people do not know. {Already the word has come into eˆect upon most of them, so they do not believe. Indeed, We have put shackles on their necks, and they are to their chins, so they are with heads [kept] aloft. And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see. And it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them Œ they will not believe. You can only warn one who follows the message and fears the Most Merciful unseen. So give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward} [Y˛s˝n: 7-11]ﬂ [Six Great Bene˚cial Fundamentals].After this, every person should destroy the various idols that were erected inside the hearts by the ﬁjih˛d˝ﬂ muqallid˝n in an attempt to inhibit the growth of the Khil˛fah. Every deviant statue should be defaced until emulation is of Allah™s Messenger   alone and bay™ah is to the Qurash˝ Im˛m alone. No hizb˝ idol should become an obstacle for the Muslim upon his path towards the Khil˛fah. May Allah guide the truthful to the truth and expose the hypocrisy of the hypocrites.Knowledge should be in the hearts and re˝ected in one™s deeds, not merely on the shelves15dabiq16ARTICLEAs the Hour approaches, it becomes important to rupon the fabricated accounts of future events, as they will undoubtedly play a role in actions taken up by various deviant sects. Of these accounts is that of the ﬁMahd˝ﬂ of the R˛˚dah who wages war against Islam and the Muslims, contrary to the just and rightly guided Mahd˝ of the future described in the Sunnah. ˜e closer the Hour approaches, the more the R˛˚dah fall in line with the Jews in preparation for the appearance of this awaited evil leader. Upon reading the R˛˚d˝ account of the ﬁMahd˝,ﬂ it becomes clear that he is none other than the Dajj˛l.According to the R˛˚dah, the ﬁMahd˝ﬂ is the so-called son of al-Hasan al-‚Askar˝ named ﬁMuhammad.ﬂ Al-Hasan al-‚Askar˝ died almost 1200 years ago. ˜ey claim Muhammad the ﬁMahd˝ﬂ was born around the time of his father™s death. ˜e scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah doubt that al-Hasan al-‚Askar˝ ever had any surviving sons, yet the R˛˚dah claim he had a son who was hidden by his father or his relatives and who ultimately went into hiding near S˛marr˛™ and would reappear before the Hour after living in hiding more than a thousand years, or so they claim. Here, we will quote some of the narrations about their ﬁMahd˝ﬂ from their ﬁmost authoritativeﬂ1 books.˜e R˛˚d˝ an-Nu™m˛n˝ reports in his book ﬁAl-Ghaybah,ﬂ ﬁWhen the Im˛m [the ‚Mahd˝™] calls out, he will supplicate Allah through His Hebrew name.ﬂ1 Authenticity is something impossible for a lying R˛ˆd˝ to ever achieve, as they are infa-mous for being the greatest liars of the creation. But despite the blatant fabrication of their narrations, they act in accordance to the false beliefs they hold, just as the Jews will follow the Dajj˛l about whom they fabricated claims, while claiming that the Dajj˛l is the Messiah.In the book ﬁAl-K˛f˝,ﬂ the R˛˚d˝ al-Kulayn˝ titled a chapter with the following: ﬁChapter: When the Im˛ms Emerge ˜ey Will Rule by the Laws of David and the Family of David.ﬂ He then reported that Ja™far as-S˛diq said, ﬁWhen al-Q˛™im [the ‚Mahd˝™] from the family of Muhammad emerges, he will rule by the Law of David and Solomon.ﬂ In another report, Ja™far as-S˛diq said, ﬁ˜e world will not end until a man from my oˆspring rules by the Law of David.ﬂ Al-Kulayn˝ also reported that Ja™far as-S˛diq was asked, ﬁBy what law will you rule?ﬂ He responded, ﬁBy the Law of the House of David.ﬂIn ﬁAl-Irsh˛d,ﬂ the R˛˚d˝ at-T˙s˝ reports that Ja™far as-S˛diq said, ﬁFrom al-K˙fah will come forth with al-Q˛™im twenty seven men from the people of M˙s˛, the Seven Sleepers of the Cave, Joshua, Solomon, Ab˙ Duj˛nah al-Ans˛r˝, al-Miqd˛d, and M˛lik al-Ashtar. ˜ey will be his supporters.ﬂ˜e R˛˚d˝ al-Majlis˝ reports in ﬁBih˛r al-Anw˛rﬂ that Ja™far as-S˛diq said, ﬁAl-Q˛™im will deal with the Arabs in accordance with the red code.ﬂ He was asked, ﬁWhat is the red code?ﬂ He responded by passing his ˚nger over his neck to indicate killing. Al-Majlis˝ also reported that Ja™far as-S˛diq said, ﬁFear the Arabs, for they have an evil future. Indeed, not a single of them will follow al-Q˛™im when he emerges.ﬂ˜e R˛˚d˝ an-Nu™m˛n˝ reports in ﬁAl-Ghaybahﬂ that Muhammad al-B˛qir said, ﬁIf the people knew what al-Q˛™im will do when he emerges most of them would not like to see him due to how many people he kills. He will 17dabiqonly begin his killings by killing Quraysh. He will not accept from them anything but war and he will not oˆer them anything but the sword.ﬂ An-Nu™m˛n˝ also reports that Ja™far as-S˛diq said, ﬁWhen al-Q˛™im from the family of the Prophet emerges, he will bring ˚ve hundred people from Quraysh and strike their necks. He will then bring ˚ve hundred more and strike their necks. He will do so six times [thereby killing three thousand men from Quraysh]. He will kill them and their patrons.ﬂ He also reports that Ja™far as-S˛diq2 said, ﬁWhen al-Q˛™im emerges, nothing will be between him and both the Arabs and Quraysh except the sword.ﬂSo the R˛˚d˝ ﬁMahd˝ﬂ speaks in Hebrew, rules by the Torah, is followed by the Jews, and kills the Arabs especially Quraysh! Is this a description of the Mahd˝ or the Dajj˛l? Consider that seventy thousand Jews from Asbah˛n (Isfahan of modern-day Iran) will follow the Dajj˛l as in the had˝th reported by Muslim from Anas .Also consider that the Dajj˛l will emerge from the region of the Khaw˛rij as in the had˝th reported by Ibn M˛jah from Ibn ‚Umar . And also consider that those who deny Qadar are from the followers of the Dajj˛l as in the had˝th reported by Ab˙ D˛w˙d from Hudhayfah . ˜is is important for two reasons, the R˛˚dah are from the biggest Kh˛rij˝ sects. ˜ey and the other Khaw˛rij have a common root in the Jew ‚Abdull˛h Ibn Saba™, who partook in the mutiny against the righteous Khal˝fah ‚Uthman . For this reason, some of the scholars have also referred to the Khaw˛rij as ﬁSaba™iyyah.ﬂ3  In 2 Note that Muhammad al-B˛qir, Ja™far as-S˛diq, and al-Hasan al-‚Askar˝  were not R˛-ˆdah. ˜ey were from the family of the Prophet  just as ‚Al˝, F˛timah, al-Hasan, and al-Husayn  were from the family of the Prophet . And just as the R˛ˆdah fabricated lies in the name of ‚Al˝ and his immediate family , they fabricated lies in the name of his noble descendants .3 ˜e closeness of the R˛ˆdah to the other Khaw˛rij is visible in the wal˛™ between Iran addition, the R˛˚dah are infamous for pronouncing takf˝r upon the majority of the Ummah including the best of the Ummah Œ the Companions of the Prophet  Œ rejecting the authority of the khulaf˛™, even cooperating with the Crusaders and the Tatars against the khulaf˛™ and their Muslim subjects. ˜e R˛˚dah have a history of massacring Muslims who refuse R˛˚d˝ beliefs. ˜is became most manifest during the Safaw˝ empire (ﬁ1501-1736CEﬂ) and its war against Ahlus-Sunnah in Persia. Finally, the R˛˚dah are one of the sects of Qadariyyah, as they deny that good and evil deeds are by Allah™s qadar.Hence the apostate R˛˚dah combined between major shirk (worship of the family of the Prophet ), denial of the Qur™˛n and the Sunnah (as they claim the Companions fabricated the religious texts), takf˝r of the Companions and the Mothers of the Believers , and belief in the deviant innovations of the Khaw˛rij and Qadariyyah. When rthat the Jews await their so-called Messiah Œ as the Jews deny the messengership of Jesus , who will return before the Hour Œ it is expected that the R˛˚dah will ally blatantly with the Jews in the future in their war against Islam and the Muslims.4 We seek refuge with Allah for Ahlus-Sunnah from the evil of the Dajj˛l.and Oman. Oman is ruled solely and populated mostly by the Ib˛diyyah. ˜e Ib˛diyyah are historically a deviant Kh˛rij˝ sect; but over the last centuries they have mutated into an apostate Jahm˝ sect. ˜eir t˛gh˙t ﬁsultanﬂ legislates manmade laws and has wal˛™ to the Crusaders, the Arab and non-Arab taw˛gh˝t including ˘l Sal˙l, and the R˛ˆdah.4 Although it is not possible to know with certainty how exactly such will come about, it is interesting to note that 340 Jewish American rabbis recently wrote a letter addressed to the American congress in support of American-Iranian reconciliation, as reported by ﬁI24Newsﬂ (a Jewish news channel) on ﬁ18 August 2015ﬂ in an article titled ﬁHundreds of US Rabbis Voice Support for Iran Nuclear Deal.ﬂ ˜e report adds that the Jewish Defense Forces Military Intelligence Directorate™s Research Department presented its stance to the political leadership of the Jewish state and ﬁemphasized the possible beneˆts that could come of the deal.ﬂ70,000 Jews from Asbah˜n will follow the Dajj˜l18ARTICLE19dabiq˜e past year has seen a number of high-pro˚le race-related incidents dominate the headlines in America, bringing the topic of racism back into the spotlight across the country, and like most other major issues that take center stage in the crusader media, racism does not go ignored by the Muslim minority living in the lands of kufr. ˜eir ﬁleadersﬂ address the issue with an eˆort to give the topic an ﬁIslamicor, but typically fall short. When tackling the issue from such a perspective, ﬁIslamicﬂ preachers and writers often do so with humanistic undertones that seek to portray Islam as a religion of peace that teaches Muslims to coexist with all. Deluded by the open-ended concept of ﬁtolerance,ﬂ they cite numerous ˛y˛t and ah˛d˝th that Œ rightfully so Œ serve to demonstrate that racial hatred has no place in Islam, but they do so for the purpose of advancing an agenda that attempts to ﬁIslamizeﬂ more ﬁliberalﬂ concepts that the kuˆ˛r apply across the board for achieving evil, such as political pluralism, freedom of religion , and acceptance of sodomites. In doing so, these ﬁdu™˛tﬂ seek to encourage the k˛˚r societies they live in to be more accepting of them, rather than meeting the enmity of the mushrik˝n with hatred and disavowal. ˜ey forego the concept of wal˛™ and bar˛™ (loyalty and disavowal for the cause of Allah), not bothering to educate their readers of the Muslim™s obligation to reject kufr, separate himself from the kuˆ˛r, abandon their lands, harbor enmity and hatred towards them, and wage war against them until they submit to the truth.{˜ere has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibr˛h˝m and those with him, when they said to their people, ﬁIndeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah aloneﬂ} [Al-Mumtahanah: 4].˜e example of Ibr˛h˝m and those with him Œ meaning the prophets of Allah, as mentioned by the scholars of tafs˝r Œ which was praised by Allah as being an excellent example for us to follow, is for one to be prepared to reject his own people when they fall into kufr and shirk, and not to remain attached to them on account of tribal or blood ties. If this is the case with one™s own people with whom a common lineage is shared, how much more so in the case of those with whom one shares nothing more than a super˚cial characteristic such as skin color!˜us, the correct way to approach the issue of racism from an Islamic perspective is to reassert the importance and signi˚cance of wal˛™ and bar˛™, and to state in clear and unequivocal terms that those who wage war against Islam and the Muslims will not be spared on account of their skin color or ethnicity. ˜e fate of a k˛˚r waging war against the Muslims is one and the same across the entire racial spectrum Œ slaughter.˜e reason for this is simple: A Muslim™s loyalty is determined, not by his skin color, his tribal aˇliation, or his last name, but by his faith. He loves those whom Allah loves and hates those whom Allah hates. He forges alliances for the cause of Allah and breaks relations for the cause of Allah. ˜e mufassir of the Ummah, ‚Abdull˛h Ibn ‚Abb˛s  said, ﬁLove for the sake of Allah, hate for the sake of Allah, make allegiance for the sake of Allah, and make enemies for the sake of Allah, for the wil˛yah (loving guardianship) of Allah is not attained except by this. One will not ˚nd the taste of ˝m˛n, even if his prayer and fasting is great, until he is like thisﬂ [Reported by Ibn al-Mub˛rak in ﬁAz-Zuhdﬂ and by al-L˛lik˛™˝].˜is statement of Ibn ‚Abb˛s echoes that made by the Prophet  when declaring wal˛™ and bar˛™ to be the strongest bond of faith. Al-Bar˛™ Ibn ‚˘zib  said that they were sitting with the Prophet  when he asked, ﬁWhat bond of Islam is the strongest?ﬂ ˜ey said, ﬁ˜e prayer.ﬂ He said, ﬁIt is good, but it is not it.ﬂ ˜ey said, ﬁ˜e zak˛h.ﬂ He said, ﬁIt is good, but it is not it.ﬂ ˜ey said, ﬁFasting Ramad˛n.ﬂ He said, ﬁIt is good, but it is not it.ﬂ ˜ey said, ﬁ˜e hajj.ﬂ He said, ﬁIt is good, but it is not it.ﬂ ˜ey said, ﬁJih˛d.ﬂ He said, ﬁIt is good, but it is not it. Indeed, the strongest bond of Islam is to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allahﬂ [Reported by Im˛m Ahmad and others].It was this principle Œ the strongest and most ˚rm bond of Islam Œ that led Ab˙ Bakr as-Sidd˝q  to spend an enormous quantity of wealth in order to purchase the Ethiopian slave Bil˛l  and set him free. When Bil˛l™s owner Umayyah ridiculed Ab˙ Bakr at the conclusion of the transaction stating that he would have sold him for one tenth of the price they™d agreed on, Ab˙ Bakr retorted that if Umayyah had demanded ten times the agreed price he would have paid it. Years later, Ab˙ Bakr and 300 other Arabs would march forth in the Battle of Badr alongside the former Ethiopian slave striking the necks of their own people. ˜at day would be referred thereafter as the Day of Furq˛n, the day that Allah divided between truth and falsehood at the hands of a people who slay and imprison their own people for the cause of Allah. No day before it made it more clear that all past aˇliations were broken, leaving only one bond remaining Œ the bond between a believing Muslim and 20ARTICLEhis brother, regardless of race or ethnicity. ˜us, it was not strange to the believers to hear the Prophet  declare that his own father, as well as his closest uncle, Ab˙ T˛lib, were both disbelievers who would be punished by Allah in Hell, while also stating that he had heard Bil˛l™s footsteps in Jannah.And if one were to have any doubt that this ˚rm bond is upheld by the soldiers and leaders of the Islamic State, they could simply look to 1400 R˛˚dah massacred by their fellow Iraqis and Arabs, or the countless spies dispatched to the Islamic State by the various nations of the world only to be executed by their fellow countrymen. Here in the Islamic State, all aˇliations are null and void ™s allegiance to Islam and the Muslims. So the Syrian muj˛hid doesn™t hesitate to trample on the Sdoesn™t think twice about setting ˚re to the ﬁstar-spangled banner.ﬂ ˜e muh˛jir˝n and ans˛r have recognized that their strength is in their unity upon tawh˝d, not in any racial aˇliations.Indeed, the pan-Arabism of the Baathist regimes Œ including those of Bashar, Saddam, and Nasser Œ is beneath the feet of the Arab muj˛hid˝n of the Khil˛fah, amongst whom are those who traveled as far as Khur˛s˛n to sacri˚ce their blood and their wealth for the cause of Allah, and to defend their non-Arab brothers when the Russians ˚rst invaded several decades ago, and once more when the Americans invaded in ﬁ2001.ﬂ Muslims from all over the Arab world likewise abandoned their homes, families, and comfortable lifestyles to answer the call of jih˛d in places as far away and obscure as the forests of Chechnya, the mountains of Bosnia, and the deserts of Mali. ˜eir readiness to sacri˚ce for the sake of Allah to defend their non-Arab brothers is exempli˚ed in the words of Shaykh Ab˙ Mus™ab az-Zarq˛w˝ who once stated, ﬁWe perform jih˛d so that Allah™s word becomes supreme and the religion becomes completely for Allah. {And ˚ght them until there is no ˚tnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah} [Al-Anf˛l: 39]. Everyone who opposes this goal or stands in the path of this goal is an enemy to us and a target for our swords, whatever his name may be and whatever his lineage may be. We have a religion that Allah revealed to be a scale and a judge. Its statement is decisive and its judgment is not amusement. It is the kinship between us and the people, for our scales Œ by Allah™s grace Œ are divine, our laws are Qur™˛nic, and our judgments are upon the prophetic tradition. ˜e American Muslim is our beloved brother, and the k˛˚r Arab is our despised enemy even if he and we were to have shared the same wombﬂ [Al-Mawqif ash-Shar™˝ Min Huk˙mat Karazay al-™Iraq].Today, non-Arab Muslims come to the lands of the Khil˛fah in the heart of the Arab world from all corners of the earth and are received by their Arab brothers with enthusiasm, so they can stand together and wage war against the taw˛gh˝t, both Arab and non-Arab alike. ˜eir ˚erce loyalty towards one another is rooted in their ˝m˛n in Allah and their disbelief in the t˛gh˙t, and is exempli˚ed in the following words of their am˝r, the Khal˝fah of the Muslims, Shaykh Ibr˛h˝m Ibn ‚Aww˛d al-Husayn˝.ﬁO Muslims everywhere, glad tidings to you and expect good. Raise your head high, for today Œ by Allah™s grace Œ you have a state and khil˛fah, which will return your dignity, might, rights, and leadership. It is a state where the Arab and non-Arab, the white man and black man, the easterner and westerner are all brothers. It is a khil˛fah that gathered the Caucasian, Indian, Chinese, Sh˛m˝, Iraqi, Yemeni, Egyptian, Maghrib˝ (North African), American, French, German, and Australian. Allah brought their hearts together, and thus, they became brothers by His grace, loving each other for the sake of Allah, standing in a single trench, defending and guarding each other, and sacri˚cing themselves for one another. ˜eir blood mixand goal, in one pavilion, enjoying this blessing, the blessing of faithful brotherhood. If kings were to taste this blessing, they would abandon their kingdoms and ˚ght over this grace. So all praise and thanks are due to Allah. ˜erefore, rush O Muslims to your state. Yes, it is your state. Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians, and Iraq is not for the Iraqis. ˜e earth is Allah™s. {Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous} [Al-A™r˛f: 128]. ˜e state is a state for all Muslims. ˜e land is for the Muslims, all the Muslimsﬂ [A Message to the Muj˛hid˝n and the Muslim Ummah in the Month of Ramad˛n].Indeed, racism is a tool of Shayt˛n, which, like nationalism, is intended to divide and weaken the children of ˘dam and prevent them from uniting upon the truth. For just as nationalists would never wage jih˛d beyond their borders to spread Islam to the corners of the earth and wipe out shirk, likewise racists would not be inclined to disavow any members of their race except for those whom they deem ﬁself-hating,ﬂ let alone ˚ght them for the sake of raising high the word of Allah. ˜e Muslim, however, does not accept the Ummah remaining divided in the name of petty concepts, for he recognizes that the only acceptable line of division is that which separates between a Muslim and a k˛˚r, whereas any other course of division would only be a source of weakness.21dabiq{And do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart} [Al-Anf˛l: 46].It™s important to note that the forces of kufr and apostasy have understood that they are further weakened when divided. As such, they regularly hasten to set aside their diˆerences for the sake of waging war against the truth, for just as Shayt˛n incites the children of ˘dam to split and divide along racial, ethnic, and tribal lines in order to divert them from maintaining the ˚rm bond of wal˛™ and bar˛™, so too does he incite them to set aside such petty diˆerences for the sake of uniting them in waging war against Islam. His incitement of the kuˆ˛r and taw˛gh˝t to that end has today culminated in the formation of an alliance of over 60 nations to ˚ght the Islamic State! And as Allah informs us, the answer to any coalition of disbelievers seeking to wage war against Islam and the Muslims is for the Ummah to strengthen its wal˛™ and bar˛™.{And those who disbelieved are allies of one another. If you do not do so, there will be ˚tnah on earth and great corruption} [Al-Anf˛l: 73].So let every Muslim who wishes to taste the sweetness of wal˛™ and bar˛™ follow the example of Ibr˛h˝m  and declare enmity towards the kuˆ˛r amongst his own people Œ whether black, white, Arab, or non-Arab Œ and then march forth and wage war against them with whatever means are available to him.22ARTICLE˜e repeated events of Syrians and Libyans dying on the shores of Turkey, Libya, and Italy, or even on the highways of Austria, is one that should awaken the heart into re˚ecting upon the issue of hijrah.{Indeed, those whom the angels take [in death] while wronging themselves Œ [the angels] will say, ﬁIn what [condition] were you?ﬂ ˜ey will say, ﬁWe were oppressed in the land.ﬂ ˜e angels will say, ﬁWas not the earth of Allah spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?ﬂ For those, their refuge is Hell Œ and evil it is as a destination. Except for the oppressed among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way Œ For those it is expected that Allah will pardon them, and Allah is ever Pardoning and Forgiving} [An-Nis˛: 97-99].Ras˙lull˛h  said, ﬁAllah  does not accept any deed from a mushrik after he accepts Islam until he departs from the mushrik˝n and goes to the Muslimsﬂ [Reported by an-Nas˛™˝ and Ibn M˛jah on the authority of Mu™˛wiyah Ibn Haydah].1Although the obligation of hijrah is clear, a mistake is regularly committed by claimants of Islam, and that is in choosing their destination for ﬁhijrah.ﬂ ˜ey always choose the lands of the Christians for their destination. But after the establishment of the prophetic state, hijrah was to al-Mad˝nah not al-Habashah. And during the Umaw˝ and ‚Abb˛s˝ rule, hijrah was to the lands of the khil˛fah not Rome and Constantinople. And with the revival of Islam™s state, hijrah is to the wil˛y˛t of the Khil˛fah, not to Nusayr˝, R˛˚d˝, Sahwah, or PKK territory, nor to America, Europe, and their t˛gh˙t allies.Hijrah is an obligation from d˛rul-kufr to D˛rul-Isl˛m. Ibn Qud˛mah, for example, said, ﬁChapter on Hijrah: Hijrah is to abandon d˛rul-kufr for D˛rul-Isl˛m.ﬂ He then quoted the verses referenced earlier and other proofs. He then said, ﬁ˜e ruling of hijrah will remain and will not cease until Resurrection Dayﬂ [Al-Mughn˝]. Ibnul-Qayyim  said that ﬁif the laws of Islam are not 1 See also pages 28-29 of issue #8 and pages 25-34 of issue #3.implemented somewhere, it is not D˛rul-Isl˛mﬂ [Ahk˛m Ahl adh-Dhimmah]. ˜is is evident, as the Sah˛bah did not consider the lands overcome by the false prophets or the resistance against zak˛h to be anything but d˛rul-harb. ˜e fuqah˛™ after them did not consider the lands ruled by the Tatar or ‚Ubayd˝ rulers to be D˛rul-Isl˛m, for although these rulers claimed Islam and ruled by some of its laws, they committed apostasy by abandoning some of its laws or teachings. Accordingly, moving to the lands of ˘l Sal˙l or the Sahw˛t is not hijrah, as the rulers of these lands Œ in addition to them allying with the crusaders and apostates against Islam Œ abandon and resist many of the laws of the Shar˝™ah. ˜ere is no w˛l˛™ and bar˛™ there except on a nationalist basis.Sadly, some Syrians and Libyans are willing to risk the lives and souls of those whom they are responsible to raise upon the Shar˝™ah Œ their children Œ sacri˚cing many of them during the dangerous trip to the lands of the war-waging crusaders ruled by laws of atheism and indecency. Although most of these families leave from d˛rul-kufr Œ Sahwah, PKK, or regime territory Œ to the crusaders™ lands, the possibility of families leaving the Khil˛fah for America or Europe in pursuit of the Duny˛ is a matter that should bring focus to the ruling of abandoning D˛rul-Isl˛m for d˛rul-kufr.˜erefore, it should be known that voluntarily leaving D˛rul-Isl˛m for d˛rul-kufr is a dangerous major sin, as it is a passage towards kufr and a gate towards one™s children and grandchildren abandoning Islam for Christianity, atheism, or liberalism. If one™s children and grandchildren don™t fall into kufr, they are under the constant threat of fornication, sodomy, drugs, and alcohol. If they don™t fall into sin, they will forget the language of the Qur™˛n Œ Arabic Œ which they were surrounded by in Sh˛m, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere, making the return to the religion and its teachings more diˇcult.˜ere are several narrations in the Sunnah on the prohibition of going back to one™s homeland after hijrah, a case similar to that of abandoning D˛rul-Isl˛m for d˛rul-kufr. 23dabiqIbn Mas™˙d  said, ﬁ˜e taker, giver, and contractor of rib˛ Œ if they know the deal is rib˛ Œ as well as the giver and receiver of tattoos for beauty, the abandoner of zak˛h, and the revert to being a Bedouin after hijrah are all cursed upon the tongue of Muhammad  until Resurrection Dayﬂ [Reported by an-Nas˛™˝ from Ibn Mas™˙d].˜e Prophet  said, ﬁ˜e muh˛jir can stay three days in Makkah after completing his [‚Umrah or Hajj] ritesﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˛r˝ and Muslim from al-‚Al˛™ Ibn al-Hadram˝].‚Al˝ Ibn Ab˝ T˛lib  said, ﬁIndeed, the major sins are seven.ﬂ ˜e people were noisy, so he repeated his statement three times and then said, ﬁWill you not ask me about them?ﬂ ˜ey said, ﬁO Am˝rul-Mu™min˝n, what are they?ﬂ He replied, ﬁShirk, murder, defaming the chaste woman, taking the wom battle, and going back to the desert as a Bedouin after hijrahﬂ [Reported by at-Tabar˝ in his tafs˝r].Al-Q˛d˝ ‚Iy˛d said, ﬁ˜e Ummah has ijm˛™ on the prohibition of the muh˛jir abandoning his hijrah and returning to his homeland and that the muh˛jir going back to being a Bedouin is a major sinﬂ [Sharh Sah˝h Muslim Œ an-Nawaw˝].Ibn Hajar said while commenting on the had˝th of al-‚Al˛™ Ibn al-Hadram˝ quoted above, ﬁFrom the ˚qh of this had˝th is that residence in Makkah was har˛m for those who performed hijrah from it before the Conquest of Makkah. But it was permissible for one who intended it for Hajj or ‚Umrah to remain there for not more than three days after completing his ritesﬂ [Fath al-B˛r˝].It is important to note that in the had˝th of Ibn Mas™˙d  quoted above as well as in the discussion between Salamah Ibn al-Akwa™  and al-Hajj˛j on becoming a Bedouin after hijrah [Reported by al-Bukh˛r˝ and Muslim], in addition to other ah˛d˝th and ˛th˛r, returning to the desert as a Bedouin is referred to with the word root of ﬁriddah.ﬂ Ibn al-Ath˝r commented, ﬁ˜ey [the Salaf] used to consider the person who after his hijrah returns to his homeland without excuse like a murtaddﬂ [An-Nih˛yah]. ˜is is probably because such a person Œ in some regards Œ forsakes aspects of Islam including hearing, obeying, jam˛™ah, jih˛d, mas˛jid, etc. And according to some scholars, moving to d˛rul-kufr from D˛rul-Isl˛m is apostasy, whereas others con˚rm that it borders apostasy.Ibn Hazm said, ﬁIf he moves there [the lands of the crusaders and pagans] for the sake of what he might acquire from duny˛ but lives there like a dhimm˝ Œ despite being able to join the body of the Muslims and reach their land Œ then his deed is not far from kufr and we ˚nd no excuse for himﬂ [Al-Muhall˛].Al-Hasan Ibn Hayy (died 169AH) said, ﬁIf a man moves to d˛rul-harb without apostatizing from Islam, he is a murtadd for abandoning D˛rul-Isl˛mﬂ [Mukhtasar Ikhtil˛f al-‚Ulam˛™ Œ at-Tah˛w˝].Going back to d˛rul-kufr is certainly a major sin that can reach the level of apostasy if it entails, for example, voluntarily moving to a land where the person will be forced into kufr, as the excuse of coercion is not valid when the individual brings this condition upon himself. Similarly is the case if he agrees to stipulations of kufr Œ such as cooperating with the kuˆ˛r against the Muslims Œ so as to be permitted entry into d˛rul-kufr. ˜is is kufr even if he does not go through with his promise. {Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the People of the Book, ﬁIf you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone Œ ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you.ﬂ But Allah testi˚es that they are liars. If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. And [even] if they should aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then [thereafter] they will not be aided} [Al-Hashr: 11-12]. And there are many other acts of kufr that one can potentially fall into when travelling to d˛rul-kufr.May Allah facilitate for the Muslims hijrah to the Khil˛fah despite the plots of the crusaders and the apostates.Many Syrians died on the roadto d˜rul-kufr24HISTORYbr˛h˝m at-Taym˝  (died 92AH) said, ﬁWho can be safe of tribulation after the Khal˝l of Allah, Ibr˛h˝m  said, O Lord {and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols} [Ibr˛h˝m: 35]ﬂ [Reported by at-Tabar˝ in his tafs˝r].Umm Salamah was asked, ﬁWhat was the most repeated du™˛™ of Allah™s Messenger  when he was with you?ﬂ She responded, ﬁHis most repeated du™˛™ was, ‚O turner of the hearts, keep my heart ˚rm upon Your religion.™ﬂ She said that she asked him, ﬁO Allah™s Messenger, why is your most repeated du™˛™: ‚O turner of the hearts, keep my heart ˚rm upon Your religion™?ﬂ He responded, ﬁO Umm Salamah, there is not a single human except his heart is between two ˚ngers of Allah™s ˚ngers. So whomever He wills He makes upright. And whomever He wills He leaves astrayﬂ [Hasan: Reported by at-Tirmidh˝].Ibn Ab˝ Mulaykah said, ﬁI met thirty of the Companions of the Prophet . All of them would fear hypocrisy for themselvesﬂ [Quoted by al-Bukh˛r˝ in his sah˝h].‚Umar  said, ﬁWe almost committed kufr in a single morning if not that Allah saved us through Ab˙ Bakr as-Sidd˝q ﬂ [Reported by Ibn Battah in ﬁAl-Ib˛nah al-Kubr˛ﬂ].˜is was the attitude of the Salaf. ˜en generations came thereafter infected with the disease of irj˛™ to the point that some dared to claim that their faith was equal to that of Jibr˝l! ˜ey did not fear minor hypocrisy, never mind major hypocrisy, never mind blatant apostasy. ˜ey were certain they were righteous, and certain they were sincere, and therefore their IRabbani - From the Afghan warto the embrace of the R˜˚dah25dabiqdeeds would certainly be accepted, and thereafter they would certainly have a pious ending! May Allah protect our hearts and deeds from hypocrisy and pride.And so, for the sake of clari˚cation, in these pages of history wesent a list of militants1 and even ﬁmuj˛hid˝nﬂ who fell into blatant apostasy by either siding with the crusaders or the taw˛gh˝t against the muj˛hid˝n or entering into the religion of parliaments and t˛gh˙t presidencies. ˜ereafter, one should not be surprised when he sees the various factions in Sh˛m or elsewhere siding with the Sahwah, the taw˛gh˝t, or the crusaders, against the Islamic State.Abdul Rasul Sayyaf (former head of the ﬁIslamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan,ﬂ now a member of the t˛gh˙t parliament), Burhanuddin Rabbani (former head of the ﬁIslamic Society of Afghanistan,ﬂ died chairman of the Afghan High Peace Council), and Ahmad Shah Massoud (former military commander, died commander of the ﬁUnited Islamic Frontﬂ), were all former leaders of the major factions that fought against the communist Russians and thereafter against the communist Afghans. All three fought alongside ‚Abdull˛h ‚Azz˛m and were formerly praised by him in his speeches and letters. After the collapse of the communist Afghan regime, they together along with others established the so-called ﬁIslamic State of Afghanistanﬂ in ﬁ1992.ﬂ ˜is ﬁstateﬂ would later organize the ﬁUnited Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistanﬂ AKA the ﬁAfghan Northern Alliance,ﬂ which fought on behalf of the crusaders and taw˛gh˝t, this becoming most manifest after the blessed operations of September 11th.1 Note: Some of the individuals and factions that will be mentioned never fought for Allah™s cause to begin with Œ similar to the condition of many of the factions in Sh˛m Œ and yet some of the ignorant consider them ﬁmuj˛hid˝nﬂ just because they fought against crusaders, communists, and other kr for nationalist reasons.Abdullo Nuri (former head of the ﬁIslamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistanﬂ) fought against the communists of Tajikstan. Am˝r Khatt˛b of Chechnya himself came to Tajikistan for jih˛d and fought alongside various groups there, including those allied with Nuri. Nuri™s group later signed a peace treaty with the communist apostates. ˜e party then became a major member of the t˛gh˙t parliament, thereby apostatizing from Islam.Abdelhakim Belhadj (Ab˙ ‚Abdill˛h as-S˛diq), Abdel Wahab Qaid (Ab˙ Idr˝s al-L˝b˝), Abdel-Hakim al-Hasidi, S˛m˝ Mustaf˛ as-S˛™id˝ (Abul-Mundhir as-S˛™id˝), were all former members of the ﬁLibyan Islamic Fighting Groupﬂ whose leadership was based in Afghanistan before September 11th and whose ˚ghters executed numerous operations in Libya against the t˛gh˙t Gadda˚ and his apostate regime. Many of these leaders had once accompanied Shaykh Us˛mah Ibn L˛din  in Afghanistan. After the collapse of the Taliban emirate, the leaders of the ﬁLibyan Fighting Groupﬂ were captured by the crusaders and later handed over to and released by the crusader puppet Gadda˚. ˜ese former jih˛d leaders would later join the t˛gh˙t parliament and partake in the shirk˝ elections after ˚ghting in the war against the t˛gh˙t Gadda˚ in ﬁ2011.ﬂSharif Sheikh Ahmed was the chief commander of the Islamic Courts Union in ﬁ2006.ﬂ During this time, he fought against the t˛gh˙t Transitional Federal Government of the Republic of Somalia.

Ali Bapir took part in the jih˛d against the t˛gh˙t Saddam and the murtadd peshmerga before the American invasion of Iraq. Once the American invasion began, he cooperated with the crusader-backed peshmerga against the muj˛hid˝n in Kurdistan and then joined the t˛gh˙t parliament. ˜e other ˚gures all took part in the jih˛d against the American crusaders before some of them ended up in crusader prisons and formed an agreement with the Americans to halt the war against the crusaders only to wage war solely against the ﬁKhaw˛rij.ﬂ ˜ey were subsequently released and convinced their various parties and subordinates to partake in this treachery.3  ˜is was the ˚rst Iraqi Sahwah whose blatant apostasy al-Q˛™idah and even Dhaw˛hir˝ himself warned against on several occasions before Dhaw˛hir˝ becoming a pawn in the hands of the Syrian Sahwah.Mohamed Abu Samra, Kamal Habib, Nabil Na™eem, Karam Zuhd˝, Abbud al-Zumar, Tarek al-Zumar, N˛jih Ibr˛h˝m, Us˛mah H˛˚dh, ‚˘sim ‚Abdil-M˛jid, ‚Is˛m Dirb˛lah, ‚Abdul-˘khir al-Ghunaym˝, and Us˛mah Rushd˝ were all former leaders of the ﬁEgyptian Islamic Groupﬂ or the ﬁEgyptian Jihad Group.ﬂ Both groups had performed jih˛d against the t˛gh˙t and murtadd forces of Egypt.

While pursuing his studies in engineering, he witnessed the injustice and oppression of the Nusayriyyah against Ahlus-Sunnah in Sh˛m, which led him to abandon his studies and emigrate to Sh˛m without delay.Upon arriving in Sh˛m prior to the announcement of the Islamic State, he joined the group ﬁMajlis Sh˙r˛ al-Muj˛hid˝n,ﬂ which at the time was led by Ab˙l-Ath˝r (ha˚dhahull˛h) and his brother Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Abs˝ and which subsequently gave bay™ah as a group to Am˝rul-Mu™min˝n Ab˙ Bakr al-Baghd˛d˝ (ha˚dhahull˛h). Since then, he spent his life in rib˛t and qit˛l on the frontlines. He performed rib˛t against Asad™s soldiers in Kh˛nt˙m˛n as well as L˝r˛m˙n and together with the soldiers of the Islamic State he repelled their advance on Kafr Hamrah. He thereafter went to as-Sikak (the railroads) for rib˛t and while there, a German brother named got bombed by the coalition planes and everyone thought that he had been killed, but a brother dragged him out of the rubble and Ab˙ Ja™far directly went on storming towards the PKK to ˚ght them.But a few days later, after the other German brothers with him had either been injured or killed, he as well ˚nally reaped what he was yearning for Œ shah˛dah for the cause of Allah. It happened during a major assault by the soldiers of the Islamic State on the atheist Kurdish factions, during which the coalition planes would come to assist these factions. ˜us, the brother was buried a second time under the rubble. After having received shah˛dah, the PKK atheists dragged his body out of the debris and presented him to the world as if they were the ones who had killed him as well as many others. But Allah knows the reality of their false claims, and our killed soldiers are in the gardens of Paradise while their dead soldiers are in the dungeons of Hell˚re.When hearing brothers expressing their desire to do something signi˚cant for the cause of Allah, Ab˙ Ja™far would say, ﬁDon™t talk about it, just do it.ﬂ He never abandoned qiy˛m al-layl and always recited the Qur™˛n, as well as the morning and evening adhk˛r.May Allah accept Ab˙ Ja™far and all the other soldiers of the Islamic State who gave their wealth, blood, and lives to establish, protect, and expand this Khil˛fah.Ab˙ Zakariyy˛ received a head injury. Ab˙ Ja™far risked his life to pull him out of the battle zone and bring him back to base to be treated.In Kh˛nt˙m˛n, he waited patiently with the other soldiers of the Islamic State to start assaulting the Nusayriyyah there, but a few days before the Sahwah treachery he went back to Kafr Hamrah to take care of some personal aˆairs. ˜en, on ﬁ3 January 2014,ﬂ the Sahw˛t began ˚ghting the Islamic State.Ab˙ Ja™far thereupon fought against Kh˛lid Hayy˛n˝™s group in Hurayt˛n, then against the Sahwah in B˛shkoy, and was one of the last to leave Hurayt˛n for I™z˛z with the German brothers of the Islamic State under the leadership of Ab˙ Ka™b .From I™z˛z they continued ˚ghting their way towards the city of al-B˛b, where he also performed rib˛t. Upon their arrival in al-B˛b he was posted with the other German brothers at the F˛r˙q Dam (formerly the ﬁTishr˝nﬂ Dam), where they participated in the liberation of Sirr˝n as well as the silos there which were formerly under the control of the ˚lthy PKK and Liw˛™ ˜uww˛r ar-Raqqah. ˜ereafter, he went with his brother to al-Khayr to ˚ght against the Sahwah factions and the Shu™ayt˛t tribe.After the liberation of al-Khayr from the Sahwah, he went to ‚Ayn al-Isl˛m, where he became known for his courage. He was once in a house that 39dabiq40TO OUR SISTERS41dabiqIndeed, when Allah obligated jih˛d for His cause upon his male slaves and placed a tremendous reward in it not found in other duties, some women became jealous and envious. So the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salamah  asked the Prophet , according to the had˝th of Muj˛hid, ﬁO Messenger of Allah, the men go out to battle and we do not go out to battle–ﬂ So Allah revealed: {And do not wish for that by which Allah has made some of you exceed others} [An-Nis˛™: 32], as reported by at-Tirmidh˝ and others.Still, the absence of an obligation of jih˛d and war upon the Muslim woman Œ except in defense against someone attacking her Œ does not overturn her role in building the Ummah, producing men, and sending them out to the ˚erceness of battle.˜erefore, I write this article for my Muslim sister, the wife of a muj˛hid and the mother of lion cubs.Allah  said, {But among them is he who says, ﬁOur Lord, give us good in this duny˛ and good in the Hereafter and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.ﬂ ˜ose will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account} [Al-Baqarah: 201-202].According to ‚Al˝ Ibn Ab˝ T˛lib , {good in this duny˛} refers to ﬁthe righteous wifeﬂ [Z˛d al-Mas˝r].˜awb˛n said, ﬁWhen the revelation concerning silver and gold came down, they said, ‚So what wealth should we seek to possess?™ ‚Umar said, ‚I will ˚nd out for you.™ He then rode quickly on a camel and reached him while I was on his heels. So he said, ‚O Messenger of Allah, what wealth should we seek to possess?™ He said, ‚Let one of you possess a thankful heart, a tongue that remembers Allah, and a wife that helps him in the matter of the Hereafter™ﬂ [Hasan: Reported by Im˛m Ahmad and Ibn M˛jah].May my father, mother, and myself be sacri˚ced in defense of Allah™s Messenger, who was bestowed with comprehensive speech: ﬁA wife that helps him in the matter of the Hereafter,ﬂ the Hereafter, the important matter, the ultimate goal, and the concern of the intelligent, discerning believer. How eloquent is the statement of the woman who said to her spouse when she saw him worried one day, ﬁWhy are you sad? Is it because of the Duny˛, then Allah has ˚nished decreeing it. Or is it because of the Hereafter? In which case may Allah increase you in worry!ﬂAnd you, O sister in Islam, O wife of a muj˛hid, your husband is one whom the world today agreed upon waging war against. My sister, do you know who the muj˛hid is? A man who turned his back on the Duny˛ and went out seeking his death so that the Ummah may live. And I think that on the day he came forward to marry you, if he was not a muj˛hid then, he was a muj˛hid in the making. At the very least, you were aware of his methodology and creed, and you knew what type of life he sought to live. And if he was a deviant sitting back from jih˛d at the time, he has repented to Allah, and Allah is more joyed by the repentance of His slave than a man who wakes up and ˚nds his camel next to him after losing it in the desert! So why do we ˚nd some of the muj˛hid˝n™s wives complaining about their lives? If she hears of an imminent battle that he will be in, she gets angry. If she sees him putting on war armor, she gets upset. If he goes out for rib˛t, she gets in a bad mood. If he returns late, she complains. O my sister, who deluded you and told you that the life of jih˛d is one of comfort and ease? Do you not love jih˛d and its people? Please listen. Indeed you are in jih˛d when you await the return of your husband patiently, anticipating Allah™s reward, and making du™˛™ for him and those with him to attain victory and consolidation. You are in jih˛d when you uphold your loyalty to him in his absence. You are in jih˛d when you teach his children the diˆerence between the truth and falsehood, between right and wrong. Indeed, you, my precious sister, are today the wife of a muj˛hid, and tomorrow you might be the wife of a shah˝d, or an injured ˚ghter, or a prisoner Œ so how ready is your supply of patience and steadfastness? If you are discontent and complain in times of ease and comfort, how will you be in times of harWill you be patient if he returns to you being carried with his blood pouring, or do you want your husband only when he is well?Ibn Kath˝r  said, ﬁ˜e scholars of tafs˝r and history, as well as others, said that Ayy˙b  was a wealthy man who possessed many diˆerent types of wealth, including livestock, slaves, cattle, and ample land in the region of al-Buthaynah in the land of H˙r˛n. And Ibn ‚As˛kir narrated that all of it belonged to him and that he had sons and many relatives. ˜en he was bereaved of these arious illnesses and no healthy organ remained in him except for his heart and his tongue, with which he remembered Allah , and throughout all that he was patient, anticipating reward from Allah and remembering Allah  day and night. His illness was so long, that even his friends and companions deserted him. He was expelled from his land and cast onto a garbage heap outside of it. ˜e people cut ties with him and none remained having 42TO OUR SISTERSmercy on him except for his wife. She would uphold his rights and acknowledge his history of good behavior towards herself as well as his compassion for her. ˜us, she would frequent him, tend to his aˆairs, help him take care of his needs, and look out for his interests. Her condition became weaker and her wealth depleted until she served people for money in order to feed him and take care of his sustenance, may Allah be pleased with her and make her pleased. She was patient with him in what happened to them of loss of money, children, and what she speci˚cally endurthrough her husband, the harsh ˚nancial situation, and having to serve the people after having enjoyed happiness, comfort, service, and security. And to Allah we belong and to Him we will returnﬂ [Al-Bid˛yah wan-Nih˛yah].Ibn Kath˝r  then said, ﬁAs-Sudd˝ said that Ayy˙b™fell oˆ until nothing remained except for the bones and nerves. His wife used to come to him with ash, spreading it under him. ˜en, when this went on for a long time, she said, ‚O Ayy˙b, if you would call upon your Lord He would surely relieve you.™ So he said to her, ‚Indeed I lived seventy years in good health. Shall I not at least be patient for Him for seventy years, and yet I consider this to be little for Him.™ She became distressed by that speech. She used to serve the people for money and feed Ayy˙b . After that, the people would not employ her because of their knowledge that she was Ayy˙b™s wife, fearing that something of his might strike them or that she might infect them due to her being in his company. ˜erefore, when she could not ˚nd anybody to employ her, she set out to sell one of her braids to some of the daughters of nobles for food. ˜en she came to Ayy˙b with it, so he asked her, ‚From where did you get this?™ and refused it. She said, ‚I worked in the service of people for it.™ On the next day, she did not ˚nd anybody to work for so she sold her other braid for food. ˜en she came to him with it and he refused it as well, swearing not to eat it until she informed him from where she got the food. ˜ereupon, she removed her scarf from her head. When he saw her head shaven, he said in his du™˛™, {ﬁIndeed, adversity has touched me, and You are the Most Merciful of the mercifulﬂ} [Al-Anbiy˛™: 83]™ﬂ [Al-Bid˛yah wan-Nih˛yah].Such was the wife of the Prophet of Allah, Ayy˙b, may blessings and peace from our Lord be upon him and upon our Prophet and upon all the Messengers. She remained patient in the face of her husband™and endured, and she never gave up on him when his Lory sister in religion, remember the statement of Allah , {Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account} [Az-Zumar: 10].Will you then remain steadfast if you one day are informed that your husband was captured or will you hasten to seek separation? How sad, very sad, for our prisoners! How often have their close ones forsaken them 43dabiqbefore the distant ones in this Duny˛? Nevertheless, the wife™s desertion is the most bitter and hardest. Imagine, O Muslimah, O wife of a prisoner, O you who claimed one day that you divorced your worldly life three times, imagine him staying in his narrow, dark dungeon with a wandering mind, and a sad smile rises on his face. Maybe he was thinking of you and his children at that moment and of when the ordeal would end and when Allah would join him with you? A mixture of memories and hopes comes, nothing breaks it except the call of the prison guard and his detested voice mixed with the sounds of the door creaking while he opens it. ﬁSo-and-so, you have a visitor.ﬂ So he hastens to exit with his heart racing. He sees you from afar so his injured heart smiles Œ this is based on the assumption that you two were not able to perform hijrah to the Islamic State, so he gave bay™ah from where he was and waged jih˛d in his land, and that there is no fear of evil in visiting him. He reaches you and gives you sal˛m, and begins by asking about your situation and the loved ones. So you reply to him , while you are troubled today, unlike your usual self. Your words come out sporadically and rightly so– You should stammer and be tense, rather you should wish that the ground beneath your feet splits open to swallow you before you are able to state what you™ve come to say! ﬁForgive me, but I want divorce, for my patience has run out.ﬂ Yes, just like that, and with every bit of simplicity. ˜en you depart and leave that man sitting in front of you stunned and confused. My Muslim sister, did you see the wall that separates between the two of you? Did you see those chains that bind him? All the torture that he has seen since he was imprisoned, and all the bitterness that he drank is nothing compared to your overbearing decision, and we seek refuge with Allah from the subjugation in prison by men!I recall now one of these sisters as she came to take my counsel about requesting divorce from her imprisoned husband due to her family™s pressure on her and her son. However, after days it reached me that she herself could not tolerate hardship, that she wanted divorce, and that her family were not involved in this issue at all. Some people might say this is her right if she fears for herself. So I tell them, yes this is her right, but between this right and patience are levels and meanings which none comprehends except for souls made of pure gold, that don™t change in the face of adversity and diˇcult circumstances!In contrast with this sister, I know a prisoner™s wife who is a school of patience, faithfulness, and steadfastness. Lofty as a high mountain, she raised his children and made of them lions and lionesses. She lives on his memory and waits to meet him. Ten years have passed while he is in prison. Yes, ten complete years, and she has neither changed nor wavered; I consider her such and Allah is her judge. When she sees us, she says, ﬁHave you supplicated that Allah breaks the chains of Ab˙ So-and-so?ﬂ How good she is, and her reward is with Allah.My Muslim sister, this is about a sister whose husband is a prisoner, so what if he were killed? It is narrated in ﬁAl-Bid˛yah wan-Nih˛yahﬂ from Ism˛™˝l Ibn Muhammad Ibn Sa™d Ibn Ab˝ Waqq˛s that he said, ﬁ˜e Messenger of Allah passed by a woman from Ban˝ D˝n˛r whose husband, brother, and father were injured with the Messenger of Allah in Uhud. When she was consoled regarding them she said, ‚How is the Messenger of Allah doing?™ ˜ey said, ‚He is doing well, O Umm So-and-so. He is as you love to see him, praise be to Allah.™ She said, ‚Show him to me so that I might see him!™ﬂ He said, ﬁSo they pointed him out to her, and when she saw him she said, ‚Any calamity is insigni˚cant as long as you™re not harmed™ﬂ [Al-Bid˛yah wan-Nih˛yah].Here I dedicate my speech to my muh˛jirah sisters, for how often have we heard of sisters whose husbands are killed, so the earth with all its vastness becomes constricted for them and they turn towards the lands of kufr, where their families and relatives are. And there is no ability nor strength except with Allah! I tell them, you are sinful if you leave the land of Islam and return to the land of kufr. Whoever made hijrah for the sake of her husband, then know that he is indeed departing, without doubt, if not today then tomorrow. And whoever made hijrah for the cause of Allah, then know that Allah will remain, ever-living, and He does not die. So remain steadfast, my sisters, may Allah make us steadfast, and hold onto the Islamic State with all your strength!O my sister, equip yourself with obedience and worship so that it may be your help and assistance at the time of calamities and hardships! Allah  said about Y˙nus , {And had he not been of those who exalt Allah, He would have remained inside its belly until the day they are resurrected} [As-S˛ˆ˛t: 143-144].Ibnul-Jawz˝ said, ﬁ˜e majority of the scholars are of the opinion that He means: If it weren™t for what he put forth of worship before being swallowed by the whale, he would have lingered in its belly until the day on which mankind is resurrected. Qat˛dah said, ‚˜e whale™s belly would have become his grave until the Day of Judgment. But he used to pray much in times of ease, so Allah  saved him because of that™ﬂ [Z˛dul-Mas˝r].44TO OUR SISTERSMaym˙n Ibn Mihr˛n said, ﬁI heard ad-Dahh˛k Ibn Qays saying, ‚Remember Allah in times of ease, then He will remember you in times of adversity. Indeed Y˙nus was a pious slave, remembering Allah, so when he fell into the whale™s belly, Allah said, {And had he not been of those who exalt Allah, he would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are resurrected} [As-S˛ˆ˛t: 143-144], whereas Fir™awn was a tyrannical slave, neglectful of the remembrance of Allah, so when {drowning overtook him, he said, ﬁI believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Isr˛™˝l believe, and I am of the Muslims.ﬂ Now? And you had disobeyed Him before and were of the corrupters?} [Y˙nus: 90-91]™ﬂ [Reported by Ibn Ab˝ Shaybah in his musannaf].As for you, O mother of lion cubs– And what will make you know what the mother of lion cubs is? She is the teacher of generations and the producer of men. I inform you of the statement of the Prophet , ﬁEvery one of you is a shepherd and everyone is responsible for his herd – And the woman is a shepherd in her house and is responsible for her herd.ﬂ So have you understood, my Muslim sister, the enormity of the responsibility that you carry? O sister in religion, indeed, I see the Ummah of ours as a body made of many parts, but the part that works most towards and is most eˆective in raising a Muslim generation is the part of the nurturing mother. And for that reason, you are in need of a lot of patience and goodness and what suˇces of bene˚cial knowledge in order to build a generation capable of bearing a trust that the heavens, the earth, and the mountains have all declined to bear.You know that acquiring knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim and every Muslimah, and Allah has blessed the Islamic State, which has not been stingy towards its women in providing institutions and courses on the entirety of the Shar˝™ah sciences. So shake oˆ the dust of laziness and procrastination and come forth, free yourself from ignorance and learn the matters of your religion. And our state Œ may Allah strengthen it Œ does not want from us neither praise nor thanks, neither dirham nor d˝n˛r, so may Allah reward them on our behalf and on behalf of the Muslims with the best of rewards.My Muslim sister, indeed you are a muj˛hidah, and if the we belt, then know that the weapon of the women is good behavior and knowledge. Because you will enter ˚erce battles between truth and falsehood. ˜erefore, either it is them with a corrupted generation in terms of creed and methodology Œ I™m referring to the enemies of our religion Œ or it is you with a generation that sees honor in 45dabiqthe pages of the Qurecause of this let your motivation be the motivation of an Ummah, and so that you see in the eyes of all of your lion cubs a deeply knowledgeable scholar and a conquering leader. Hope for them what Hind Bint ‚Utbah hoped for her son Mu™˛wiyah , ﬁFor Ab˙ Sufy˛n looked to him while he was crawling and said to his son™s mother, ‚Indeed this son of mine has a large head and he deserves to rule his people.™ So Hind said, ‚His people only? May I be bereaved of him if he does not not lead the Arabs altogether™ﬂ [Al-Bid˛yah wan-Nih˛yah]. Hind  got what she had hoped for. Mu™˛wiyah  led the Arabs altogether with the Shar˝™ah. And, O sister, let all your children be like the three sons of Afr˛™: Mu™˛dh, Mu™awwadh, and ‚Awf .And what a great statement was made by Asm˛™, the daughter of Ab˙ Bakr , on the day Ibn ‚Umar entered upon her when her son ‚Abdull˛h Ibn az-Zubayr  was cruci˚ed, killed by al-Hajj˛j. He said to her, ﬁ˜is body is nothing and the souls are with Allah, so fear Allah and be patient.ﬂ So she said, ﬁAnd what prevents me from patience while the head of Yahy˛, the son of Zakariyy˛, was oˆered to a prostitute from the prostitutes of Ban˝ Isr˛™˝l?ﬂ All˛hu akbar! ˜ese are the women of our Ummah! ˜e ˚rst Khans˛™ women!My beloved sister, indeed from the blessings of Allah upon you is that He honored you with the life on the soil of the Khil˛fah. So take advantage of that as much as you can to give your children a righteous upbringing upon clear tawh˝d, a correct ‚aq˝dah, kufr bit-t˛gh˙t and worship of Allah alone, teaching them the heart-softeners, the remembrance of Allah, the Prophet™s biography, and the ˚qh of jih˛d. And if the claimants of Islam in the lands of kufr raise their children on the stories of Cinderella and Robin Hood, you should make use of the stories in ﬁMash˛ri™ al-Ashw˛q il˛ Mas˛ri™ al-‚Ushsh˛qﬂ of Ibn an-Nahh˛s  as stories for your lion cubs before they sleep. And here before you are the Shar˝™ah institutions, training camps, and even the kindergartens. All of them in our state Œ may Allah support it Œ are upon the methodology of prophethood, insh˛™all˛h, and to Allah belongs all praise.Furthermore, my sisterly advice to you as you are preparing the lion cubs of the Khil˛fah is that ˚rst comes knowledge, then the weapon. ˜e danger of a weapon without knowledge is great and very rarely does it get things right. My noble sister, be like the mother of Sufy˛n ath-˜awr˝, that im˛m, muhaddith, jurist, h˛˚dh, z˛hid, and worshipper, to whom Umm Hab˝bah Œ his mother Œ one day said, ﬁO my son, seek knowledge and I will suˇce you with my spindle.ﬂ Look at her, may Allah have mercy on her and gather us with her in the gardens of our Lord! What did she wish for her son except that he study the Shar˝™ah and gain mastery in it, while she covers his provisions and subsistence with what she earns from the spindling of wool. So Allah blessed her son until Ab˙ Ish˛q as-Sab˝™˝ saw him approaching one day and said, {And We gave him judgment while he was a boy} [Maryam: 12].To conclude, I remind myself and I remind you, O my precious sister, that we must purify our intentions and take them to account in all of our deeds. ˜ose whose deeds were for the sake of Allah  have succeeded and won, and those whose deeds were for other than Allah  have failed and lost. And our ˚nal call is, ﬁAll praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the creation.ﬂ May peace and blessings be upon our leader, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions altogether.46FEATUREﬁNo man has ever come with similar to what you™ve come with but that he was met with hostility.ﬂ ˜is is how Waraqah Ibn Nawfal described to the Prophet  the awaited reaction of his people to the da™wah. Waraqah™s hope was to be with the Prophet  when the Prophet would be expelled, but Waraqah never lived to that time.˜e Prophet  afterward began the mission for which he was sent by Allah . His people responded with great hostility. ˜ey claimed he was a sorcerer, a liar, a madman, a poet, a bewitched man, a storyteller, an impersonator, amongst other claims– although they had considered him before to be truthful and trustworthy! ˜ey oˆered him kingship, women, and wealth, but he rejected it all due to his purity and for the sake of his Lord. ˜ey plotted to murder him or expel him, but Allah plotted against his enemies and ordered His Messenger  to leave the most blessed place on the Earth Œ Makkah Œ for a new abode in al-Mad˝nah.A state was established with the Prophet  directing its armies of ˚ghters against the caravans of the mushrik˝n, events that led to the Great Battle of Badr. ˜e mushrik˝n were enraged and dispatched their envoys and battalions, and soon the Muslims were are at war with the mushrik Arab and Bedouin tribes of the Arabian Peninsula and the Jews and hypocrites of al-Mad˝nah. As the prophetic state grew in strength, the envy and rage of the kuˆ˛r grew into the Battle of al-Ahz˛b (ﬁthe Partiesﬂ). ˜e Jews plotted with the hypocrites and convinced various Arab tribes to attack al-Mad˝nah while they would cause turmoil from within. Quraysh, Kin˛nah, and their allies advanced from the south. Ghataf˛n, its clans, and allies advanced from the East. ˜eir numbers reached ten thousand ˚ghters and they held al-Mad˝nah under siege for a month, while the Muslims were greatly outnumbered. But the patience they endured in the face of war, fear, hunger, and weather, led to the Muslims™ victory and the good prophetic news that henceforth they would be on the oˆense and the mushrik˝n on the defense.1 Just as the Companions had to face coalitions of various Jewish, pagan, and hypocrite parties in the battle of al-Ahz˛b, the Muslims of the Islamic State face various coalitions of kuˆ˛r having a common interest in seeing the Khil˛fah destroyed. And just as the Companions™ reaction to the parties was one of faith, {And when the believers saw the parties, they said, ﬁ˜is is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.ﬂ And it increased them only in faith and acceptance} [Al-Ahz˛b: 22], so too should the reaction of the Muslims be when seeing these numerous coalitions gathering and mobilizing. Here we attempt to provide some insight into the diˆerent coalitions so that the Muslim can strive to oppose them in word and deed 1 Allah  described the events of this decisive battle in verses 9-27 of S˙rat al-Ahz˛b for the believer to rct upon.˜e New Ahz˛b47dabiqas ﬁwhoever imitates a people is from themﬂ [Reported by Im˛m Ahmad and Ab˙ D˛w˙d from Ibn ‚Umar] and so that {the way of the criminals will become evident} [Al-An™˛m: 55].Although this coalition might appear new, it manifested in ﬁ2001ﬂ in what was known as ﬁOperation Enduring Freedom.ﬂ It quickly expanded to the Philippines, the Horn of Africa, the Trans Sahara, and the Caucasus. In ﬁ2003,ﬂ the crusaders then launched a second campaign known as ﬁOperation Iraqi Freedom.ﬂ ˜is was followed by a third campaign known as ﬁOperation Inherent Resolveﬂ launched in ﬁ2014ﬂ in both Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State.2  None of these various campaigns were successful in preventing the revival of the Khil˛fah nor its continuity nor its expansion.

Here we will provide some insight into this relationship despite the matter being more visible than the sun at noon on a clear day.Even before the blessed operations of September 11th, America had cooperated with Iran through the United Nations ﬁSix Plus Two Group on Afghanistan,ﬂ part of a plot against the muj˛hid˝n of Khur˛s˛n. After September 11th, the cooperation developed into what would become known as ﬁthe Geneva Contact Groupﬂ during the presidency of the crusader George W. Bush. It entailed Iran providing intelligence to the crusaders, building up the relationship between the crusaders and the ﬁNorthern Alliance,ﬂ and arresting muj˛hid˝n who attempted to cross the Iranian border on their way to Iraqi Kurdistan or other destinations. Iran provided some of its ports and airbases for the crusader mission, its ﬁIslamic Revolutionary Guards Corpsﬂ cooperated with US Special Ops and the CIA in Afghanistan, and it partook in the establishment of the apostate puppet Afghan regime. In the months leading up to the American invasion of Iraq, the Americans cooperated with Iran again, but this time mainly through the British Foreign and Commonwealth Oˇce. ˜e cooperation climaxed through the formation of the Safaw˝ regime of Iraq, essentially a puppet of Iran.6On ﬁ6 November 2014,ﬂ the ﬁWall Street Journalﬂ released an article titled ﬁObama Wrote Secret Letter to Iran™s 5 ˜is is a partial list.

He enforced Shiism upon the Sunn˝ population until Persia became predominately R˛˚d˝ after being predominantly Sunn˝. His policies included executing Sunn˝ scholars and massacring resistant Sunn˝ populations. He was the most anti-Sunn˝ ruler to come into power since the fall of the Ism˛™˝l˝ ‚Ubayd˝ state based in Egypt. ˜e Safaw˝ dynasty ruled from ﬁ1501-1736CE.ﬂMore than two hundred years later, the R˛˚d˝ Khomeini carried on the eˆorts of his Safaw˝ predecessors and gave the R˛˚d˝ clerics direct power in politics via the concept he had been propagating known as ﬁwil˛yat al-faq˝hﬂ (ﬁthe guardianship of the juristﬂ) and through his so-called ﬁrevolution.ﬂ Suddenly the R˛˚d˝ clerics were in direct control of Persia and within a few years, they were exporting their shirk˝ religion to Sh˛m, Iraq, the Arabian Peninsula, Khur˛s˛n, India, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Africa, and Southeast Asia.˜e R˛˚dah then overtook much of Yemen while siding with the American puppet Ali Abdullah Saleh, after already gaining power in Syria and Lebanon as a result of the Americans handing over Iraq to them after ﬁOperation Iraqi Freedom.ﬂ Suddenly the ﬁShia Crescentﬂ was growing from a crescent into a solar eclipse, ultimately threatening Islam everywhere. ˜ey united the Nusayriyyah, the Ism˛™˝liyyah, and the Zaydiyyah behind their so-called ﬁfaq˝hﬂ in a war against the Sunnah. ˜eir plan is to continue waging war against Islam until the emergence of the ﬁMahd˝ﬂ of the R˛˚dah, who, according to them, will speak Hebrew, rule by the Torah, be followed by the Jews, and kill all the Arabs Œ attributes undoubtedly be˚tting the Jewish Dajj˛l not the Muslim Mahd˝.7 ˜e fact the apostate R˛˚dah are more cohesive, organized, fervent, and aggressive than the other allies of the crusaders Œ the apostate taw˛gh˝t and sahw˛t Œ has gained them the favor of the crusaders, and accordingly, the crusaders rely upon them and the R˛˚dah™s Kurdish allies more so than others in the war against the Khil˛fah. ˜e R˛˚dah overall are more barbaric and united than the crusaders themselves, but the muwahhid˝n of the Khil˛fah have sharpened many knives and prepared until the last R˛˚d˝ under the banner of ad-Dajj˛l dies.˜e Sahwah was ˚rst named in Iraq but had existed as a phenomenon much earlier since post-Communist Afghanistan. ˜e name is drawn from the Arabic word meaning ﬁawakening.ﬂ ˜e original Iraqi Sahwah consisted of tribal gangs who began to support the American crusaders against the muj˛hid˝n in ﬁ2005,ﬂ before the establishment of the Islamic State. ˜is cooperation grew until Abdul Sattar al-Rishawi formed the ﬁAnbar Awakeningﬂ council, one of the ˚rst oˇcially American sahw˛t, supposedly ﬁawakeningﬂ to face the muj˛hid˝n. ˜ese tribal support councils sided against the Islamic State with factional sahw˛t, many of which were already tribally driven.˜e factional sahw˛t could be classi˚ed into two categories: nationalist Ikhw˛n˝-oriented resistance 7 See ﬁ˜e Mahd˝ of the R˛ˆdah: ˜e Dajj˛lﬂ in this issue of D˛biq.˜e Safaw˝ Empire˜e Sahwah Coalitions53dabiqfactions and nationalist Sur˙r˝-oriented8 ﬁjih˛d˝ﬂ factions. ˜e ﬁjih˛d˝ﬂ factions (the ﬁIslamic Army in Iraq,ﬂ ﬁJaysh al-Muj˛hid˝n,ﬂ and the ﬁShar™˝ Committee of Jaysh Ans˛r as-Sunnah,ﬂ9  and others) formed the ﬁJihad and Reform Front.ﬂ ˜e resistance factions (the ﬁ1920 Revolution Brigades,ﬂ ﬁJaysh ar-R˛shid˝n,ﬂ ﬁJaysh al-Muslim˝n ˚l-‚Ir˛q,ﬂ and others) formed the ﬁJih˛d and Change Front,ﬂ which followed the formation of another resistance coalition known as the ﬁIslamic Front for the Iraqi Resistance.ﬂ Various resistance and ﬁjih˛d˝ﬂ factions in these smaller coalitions ultimately merged into the ﬁPolitical Council for the Iraqi Resistance,ﬂ with some smaller groups remaining on the sidelines to ultimately face extinction.

He brings to their attention the reality that the Islamic State is winning and will continue to expand despite all the eˆorts of the weakened states of America. ˜e article is presented below.]Islamic State is winning,  America must soon use its one remaining optionTBy Michael Scheuer57dabiqIslamic State is winning,  America must soon use its one remaining optionterms of its regional planning, or how that planning is not only immune to but fueled by the relentless, seriatim intervention of the West in each Muslim country that displeases it Œ excepting, of course, the Muslim tyrannies the West fawns over, protects, and is bribed by. (NB: ˜is is not to argue that a multi-Muslim-nation intervention by U.S.-NATO forces is needed. First, that mother of all Western interventions would be the single most powerful ally for IS™s goal of uniting the Sunni world. Second, the U.S. military is worn out after two decades of war-losing; is being neutered by Obama™s calculated-to-destroy budget cuts, manpower reductions, and eˆeminization; and the NATO militaries Š save Turkey™s Š are tiny, antiquated, underfunded, and could not stop Putin™s panzers from rolling down the Champs Elysees without using nuclear weapons. ˜e only eˆective U.S.-NATO defense against the Islamists is to stop all intervention, and let the Sunnis, Shias, and Israelis settle their diˆerences in whatever merrily murderous manner pleases them.)Currently, IS leaders appear to have three strong regional beachheads from which they intend to expand, as well as one strategic economic target: four maritime choke-points that, if closed or even sporadically attacked, would disrupt the world™s supply of oil and hence its economy.1) ˜e Balkans: IS has established itself strongly in the Islamist communities of Bosnia, Kosovo, and Albania, and has a presence in each of the other Balkan states. In this eˆort, IS has capitalized on what is now a decades long campaign, that began with the USSR™s demise, in which Saudi Arabia, its Gulf partners, and their NGOs2 have converted large numbers of Balkans Muslims from being nominal believers to being Muslims well-schooled in the war-prone Sala˚ and Wahhabi doctrines. ˜e Saudi-led eˆort3 has not yet made the Balkans a bastion of those doctrines, but it is yielding increasing numbers of Balkan Muslims who have become Sala˚s and Wahhabis. ˜ese converts have challenged and in several cases succeeded in displacing more moderate Islamic leaders, building Islamist organizations that have sporadically attacked individuals, security forces, and buildings, and have sent a steady 2 Editor™s Note: ˜e taw˛gh˝t of ˘l Sal˙l and their allies work together to portray themselves as the caretakers of Is-lam and the Muslims, when in actuality they propagate de-viance, lewdness, and even sodomy through their ﬁRotana Groupﬂ and their other entertainment and religious outlets, never mind the fact they rule by international and domestic manmade laws and support the Jews and Christians against Islam and the Muslims. ˜eir weak and hypocritical sup-port of ﬁda™wahﬂ Œ in many cases Œ backˆred and led to peo-ple studying the Qur™˛n and the Sunnah, adopting tawh˝d and shar˝™ah, and declaring takf˝r and jih˛d against the very forces and agents of ˘l Sal˙l.3 Editor™s Note: See previous footnote.stream of volunteers Š with the aid of IS logistics units in Turkey, Greece, Spain, and Italy Š to ˚ght with IS forces in Syria and Iraq. As the IS presence in the Balkans continues to grow, a glance at the map will show the relative ease with which IS can secure access to EU countries and through the states of Eastern Europe to Russia.2) Libya: IS is encountering strong local resistance to its presence in Libya but it is an organization that can do more than one thing at a time. While its ˚ghters defend and slowly expand IS-held territory, other IS leaders and administrators are engaged in bringing order and repairing social services and public utilities in the areas they hold, a pattern seen previously in Syria and Iraq. IS also is both exploiting its new geographical position Š via successful attacks in Tunisia, and support for the IS organization in Egypt™s Sinai Peninsula Š and preparing for further advances from Libya into Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, and Sudan. Libya also gives IS cross-border access to Niger and Chad, both of which facilitate direct contact with IS™s expanding Nigerian ally Boko Haram. In addition, Niger aˆords easy entry into Mali where desperate Islamist organizations might well be enticed to cooperate with IS so as to bene˚t from its military know how, reputation for success, ample treasury, and the return of veteran Malian mujahedin who have been ˚ghting with IS in Syria, Iraq, and Libya.3) Afghanistan: IS™s presence in Afghanistan is just a year old but its ˚ghters are reported to be deployed in more than half of the country™s 34 provinces, in and near the capital of Kabul, and in Pakistan™s tribal region, Baluchistan Province, and the city of Karachi. IS is far from dominating the country, but the trickle of defectors By Michael ScheuerA Balkan muj˜hidon the frontlines of the Khil˜fah58ENEMY˚S WORDSto it from the Afghan and Pakistani Taleban has become w since the long-hidden death of Taleban chief Mullah Omar was announced on 30 July 2015 and a new leader was quickly chosen by a small number of Taleban leaders who had helped hide the fact that Omar died in April, 2013. IS strategists see Afghanistan as key to the expansion and completion of the IS Caliphate, as it provides potential revenue streams from the country™s heroin production4 and mineral wealth, and easy access Pakistan, and through it to India and Kashmir, as well as to the Muslim states of Central Asia, the Muslim Uighur population in China™s Xinjiang Province, and a base from which to potentially attack Iran, murder Shias willy-nilly, and force Tehran to ˚ght a two-front war against IS forces and their allies.4) Maritime choke-points: In its most ambitious strategic project, IS currently has the beginning of opportunities to establish its presence at four of the world™s most important maritime choke-points. ˜e entrance to Bab-el-Mandab Strait at the southern end of the Red Sea lies between IS and other Islamist groups ˚ghting for control of Yemen and the Islamist- and pirate-rich Horn of Africa; the Suez Canal is vulnerable to the IS branch now operating with near impunity in Egypt™s Sinai Peninsula; the Strait of Malacca, which runs along the shores of Indonesia™s Islamist-dominated Aceh Province; the Jakarta government claims IS™s presence and appeal in the country is quickly growing; and the Strait of Gibraltar, which has long been an al-Qaida target and is now bounded on the south by IS™s growing strength and reach in the Maghreb, and on the north by the ample IS presence in southern Europe and the reinforcements it is receiving from the IS ˚ghters salted among the mass of illegal migrants entering Europe by sea from North Africa.4 Editor™s Note: ˜e Islamic State leadership in Wil˛yat Khur˛s˛n has been the most severe against the opium farmers of Pakistan and Afghanistan Œ burning opium plantations and crops Œ as opium production is from the most evil of deeds, never mind such being from the most accursed forms of income. ˜e Akhtar-led Taliban, however, consider those who burn the crops of opium to be ﬁKhawarijﬂ who have destroyed Muslim ﬁwealthﬂ and de-vastated ﬁzak˛hﬂ collection!˜e foregoing summary describes the unambiguous price of a half-century of U.S. cultural, political, economic, and military interventionism, either unilaterally or with its NATO vassals. And this summary does not include the IS beachheads that are still under development in the North Caucasus and Yemen, which will in time enable IS expansion into Russia and into Saudi Arabia and the other Sunni Gulf States.In the face of IS™s substantial geographical and manpower expansion, U.S. leaders in both parties have maintained a basically law-and-order approach to the mujahedin and have downplayed Š when not ignoring Š IS capabilities, its motivation and intentions, and the religious war it is waging. ˜ey also have spent the last year wasting time on whining about IS beheadings, the nuclear weapon Iran cannot be prevented from attaining5, and stoking war in Europe by aiding a Ukrainian government that cannot defend itself and uselessly sanctioning a Russian regime that will not return Crimea and knows that the term ﬁpaper tigerﬂ has never been more applicable than when applied to the United States and NATO.When the time comes Š and it will Š for U.S. leaders to look in the cupboard and ˚nd a tool with which to end the IS threat, they will ˚nd it bare. With two deliberately lost wars, a broken military, a governing elite and president unattached to reality, a bankrupt treasury, a political system corrupted by the U.S.-citizen agents of foreign powers, next-to-useless European allies, a Western world that prefers its own death to slaughtering its enemy, and an Islamist enemy far smarter and more talented than it is given credit for, the U.S. governing elite will have only one option.Turning from the bare cupboard, these poor souls will know what commonsensical Americans untainted by Ivy League educations have known all along. Namely, that it is time to put America ˚rst and to return to General Washington™s foreign-policy legacy by immediately proclaiming the end of U.S. interventionism, the termination of support for all states and groups in the Middle East, the U.S. withdrawal from NATO, and the resumption of America™s most eˆective national security policy Š strict neutrality.6 And while doing this, we can all hope Š perhaps with misplaced optimism Š that it is not too late.5 Editor™s Note: ˜e apostate R˛ˆdah of Iran have the American crusaders to thank for granting them the conditions and the resources needed to facilitate development of their nuclear program into nuclear weapons to be used against Ahlus-Sunnah, never mind the fact that the crusader jets Œ in defense of Iran and its R˛ˆd˝ militias Œ target the muj˛hid˝n in Iraq and Sh˛m.6 Editor™s Note: Rather the only complete solution to America™s war with Islam is in the Americans either accepting Islam or paying jizyah. Otherwise, it can admit defeat and accept a partial solution by abiding by a temporary truce whose stipulations are in accor-dance with the Shar˝™ah.The t˜gh˚t of Qatar and the t˜gh˚t head of ˆl Sal˚l59dabiq60INTERVIEW˜is month, D˛biq had the opportunity to send some questions to the am˝r delegated by the Khil˛fah for the Libyan wil˛y˛t Œ Abul-Mugh˝rah al-Qaht˛n˝ (ha˙dhahull˛h). We present the questions and answers below.D˛biq: How is the battle situation in the Libyan wil˛y˛t of the Islamic State?Abul-Mugh˝rah: ˜e battle situation in the Libyan wil˛y˛t is one of ˚ghting the mushrik˝n altogether as they ˚ght us altogether. ˜e military situation in Libya diˆers from region to region, depending on the number of Khil˛fah soldiers and the type of enemy in addition to the social composition and geography of the various regions. Ithat form in the ranks of the apostates themselves. {You think they are together, but their hearts are diverse} [Al-Hashr: 14]. But we reassure the Muslims in the eastern and western extents of the Earth that Libya will not be ruled except by Allah™s Shar˝™ah and that the Islamic State by Allah™s grace will pave its way quickly towards consolidation and expansion.˜e Islamic State has military and security operations in Tar˛bulus, Misr˛tah, Tubruq, al-Bayd˛™, Sabr˛tah, and Ajd˛biy˛. ˜e Islamic State is manifest with some control over neighborhoods in Darnah and Bingh˛z˝ in addition to its complete authority over the seacoast region stretching from B˙qar˝n to Binjaw˛d, which includes a number of cities and regions, most important of which are Sirte, al-‚˘mirah, Har˛wah, Umm Qind˝l, and an-Nawfaliyyah.D˛biq: What is the situation of the apostate ﬁLibyan Dawnﬂ group?Abul-Mugh˝rah: ˜e ﬁLibyan Dawnﬂ is the oˇcial military wing for the ﬁGeneral National Congressﬂ democratic government (with its ﬁIslamicﬂ shroud) represented by the ﬁMuslim Brotherhoodﬂ and the ﬁLibyan Islamic Fighting Groupﬂ led by Abdelhakim Belhadj. ˜ese apostate forces wage war against Allah™s religion by abandoning the Shar˝™ah laws and replacing them with manmade laws in addition to waging war against the people of tawh˝d, dragging them to prisons, and handing them over to the crusaders. Due to their war against Allah™s religion and His awliy˛™, the Islamic State rose to repel their attacks against the Muslims and to implement the Shar˝™ah, spread justice, and save the prisoners from harm. ˜ey will continue to be a target for our swords, which we will not hold back until they repent from their kufr and their wal˛™ to Allah™s enemies from amongst the crusaders and the secularists.D˛biq: What is the situation with the t˛gh˙t Haftar?Abul-Mugh˝rah: We have a number of fronts against the t˛gh˙t Haftar, who is the head of the Libyan army under the Tubruq government in East Libya. ˜e Islamic 61dabiqState ˚ghts the apostates of the Libyan army at a number of locations near the city of Bingh˛z˝, most important of which are as-S˛bir˝ and al-Layth˝. ˜e Islamic State also has some frontlines against them near Darnah, most important of which are Mart˙bah and an-Naww˛r. ˜e Islamic State also targets their locations in the city of Ajd˛biy˛. ˜e secularist forces of Haftar are targets for the Khil˛fah soldiers wherever these forces might rest. We will not slack in ˚ghting them until there is no more ˚tnah and the religion is all for Allah.D˛biq: What is the situation with the murtadd˝n of ﬁMajlis Sh˙r˛ Darnahﬂ? And how did it all begin? And what is the history of this ﬁmajlisﬂ with regards to Islam or kufr?Abul-Mugh˝rah: ˜is council consists of two major elements: ﬁAb˙ Sal˝m Martyrs Brigadeﬂ and the ﬁLibyan Islamic Fighting Group.ﬂ As for the ﬁLibyan Islamic Fighting Group,ﬂ then its kufr is clear due to its participation in the Tar˛bulus government and the democratic process under the leadership of Abdelhakim Belhadj. As for the ﬁAb˙ Sal˝m Martyrs Brigade,ﬂ then it was a brigade that was once Salaf˝. Most of the soldiers of the Islamic State in Darnah were from the brigade™s founders. ˜ey abandoned the brigade after it fell into a number of nulli˚ers of Islam, most infamous of which was its operating as part of the interior ministry in what was known as the ﬁsecurity committee.ﬂ ˜is is in addition to their security for the t˛gh˙t Mustafa Abdul Jalil, Chairman of the National Transitional Council, when he visited Darnah and called to democracy. Since then, the people of proper methodology abandoned the brigade. ˜ey even killed leaders of the brigade who led it to the depths of kufr. All this was before the oˇcial expansion of the Islamic State to Libya. After Allah blessed it with expansion to Libya and most of the groups in Darnah pledged bay™ah to it, the Ab˙ Sal˝m brigade requested its opponents from the other groups refer to the court of the Islamic State for a resolution. After studying the condition of the brigade and what it fell into, the court of the Islamic State ruled that the brigade had committed apostasy and called its individuals to repentance. A number of its followers and leaders repented whereas the remaining gathered together with the ﬁLibyan Islamic Fighting Groupﬂ to form what they called ﬁMajlis Sh˙r˛ Darnah.ﬂD˛biq: What is the situation with Ans˛r ash-Shar˝™ah?Abul-Mugh˝rah: Many of the leaders and soldiers of Ans˛r ash-Shar˝™ah were from the ˚rst to pledge bay™ah in Libya to the Islamic State. ˜is group continues to have men who wish to implement the Shar˝™ah despite the groups™ abandonment of the lost obligation of the era and its preference of division to unity, most clear in its lack of a bay™ah to the Khal˝fah and in its unity with ﬁrevolutionaryﬂ movements linked to the apostate regime of Tar˛bulus in some regions as well as its acceptance in other regions of suspicious aid from ˚lthy hands. It also has contradictory stances from region to region due to the diˆerent orientations of its leaders and the alignments of its soldiers. Some of the contradictory stances are also due to the closeness of some of their leaders towards those of ﬁal-Q˛™idah in the Islamic Maghribﬂ present in Libya.D˛biq: How is the situation in the Libyan wil˛y˛t with respect to governance?Abul-Mugh˝rah: In Libya, the Islamic State continues to be a young mission as its presence has not completed a full year. ˜e Islamic State, for example, was able to rule The soldiers of the Khil˜fah take control of the eastern coast of the city of Darnah62INTERVIEWDarnah by Shar˝™ah despite the presence of obstacles and bitterness manifest in deviant parties and divided factions who ignored to pledge bay™ah to the Khil˛fah. ˜e result of enforcing Shar˝™ah laws upon the strong and weak and enforcing repentance upon the apostates with the presence of some of these deviant and divided factions in the region led to the Islamic State being fought by these parties altogether and their announcement of war against it.In the cities and regions that it controls, the Islamic State has laid down the proper foundation. It knows that the establishment of the religion and implementation of Shar˝™ah cannot be properly achieved with the presence of deviant and divided groups, organizations, and parties within its territory. {Establish the religion and do not be divided therein} [Ash-Sh˙r˛: 13]. And so it works to rid the lands of this menace while implementing the Shar˝™ah.D˛biq: What is the story of what took place in Darnah?Abul-Mugh˝rah: ˜e treachery of the Sahw˛t in Darnah is due to the diˆerence of rmethodologies, and the arrogance of some ﬁrevolutionaryﬂ leaders present in Darnah. ˜e Islamic State embittered these people with its pure methodology and clear path. It was able to achieve in a month what they were unable to achieve in the three years that passed. It openly declared the kufr of the apostates and called them to repentance, including the Ab˙ Sal˝m brigade. ˜e word of truth and its declaration angered them. It also removed the evils, enforced good, and banned evil. So they began their ˚lthy steps with a plot for treachery. ˜ey coordinated with the apostate ﬁLibyan Islamic Fighting Groupﬂ to make a formation, which they named ﬁMajlis Sh˙r˛ Darnah.ﬂ ˜ey also deviously took critical locations in the city in preparation to strike the Islamic State. ˜ey attempted to contrive problems so as to be an excuse to battle the Islamic State. ˜e beginning of their treachery was their targeting of two checkpoints near the western and eastern entrances to the city. ˜ey laid siege to the Islamic court cuses. {And Allah does not guide the plan of betrayers} [Y˙suf: 52].˜e Islamic State withdrew from the city center of Darnah in the beginning of the battle and made the eastern entrance to the city (the area of al-Fat˛™ih) a launch ground for its operations against these Sahw˛t. ˜ereafter, ﬁMajlis Sh˙r˛ Darnahﬂ announced the launching of the ﬁBattle of Nahraw˛nﬂ to take al-Fat˛™ih area with the aid of forces called ﬁShuhad˛™ al-Jabal,ﬂ who belong to the Libyan Haftar army. ˜e Islamic State continued to advance towards the center of Darnah. In the last few days, it retook areas of the eastern coast side of Darnah. All praise is due to Allah. And the battle carries on.D˛biq: What is the story of what took place in Sirte?Abul-Mugh˝rah: As for Sirte, then the story was not so much one of treachery but that the Islamic State had gained recent control over the city and there remained pockets in the city belonging to the supporters of the t˛gh˙t Haftar and others belonging to the supporters of the t˛gh˙t Gadda˚, as they consider Sirte his birthplace. ˜ere was also resistance from some of the Madkhal˝ Murji™ah, who carried arms against the Islamic State. ˜e destruction of these pockets of resistance was achieved and their arms and wealth was taken as booty. ˜e repentance of those who repented was also acknowledged. All praise is due to Allah.D˛biq: What kinds of needs do the Libyan wil˛y˛t have in terms of personnel (scholars, doctors, engineers, ˚ghters, etc.)?Abul-Mugh˝rah: ˜e Islamic State here in Libya is still young. It is in great need of every Muslim who can come, especially medical, shar™˝, and administrative personnel, in addition to ˚ghters.D˛biq: What is the importance of the Libyan wil˛y˛t regarding the future of the Khil˛fah and the Islamic Ummah and the war against the crusaders and apostates?Destroying a statue in the city of DarnahA number of Africans embrace Islam in the city of Sirte63dabiqAbul-Mugh˝rah: Libya has a great importance for the Muslim Ummah because it is in Africa and south of Europe. It also contains a well of resources that cannot dry. All Muslims have a right to these resources. It is also a gate to the African desert stretching to a number of African countries. It is important to note also that the Libyan resources are a concern for the k˛˚r West due to their reliance upon Libya for a number of years especially with regards to oil and gas. ˜e control of the Islamic State over this region will lead to economic breakdowns especially for Italy and the rest of the European states.D˛biq: We™ve seen the messages from our Ans˛r˝ brothers in Libya inviting Muslims around the world to perform hijrah to the Libyan wil˛y˛t of the Khil˛fah. Which regions of the world do most of the muh˛jir˝n come from?Abul-Mugh˝rah: All praise is due to Allah. ˜e muh˛jir˝n come from all places to the Islamic State especially from Africa, the Islamic Maghrib, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula and occasionally from Western nations.D˛biq: Are there any diˇculties involved in performing hijrah to Libya?Abul-Mugh˝rah: ˜ere is no reward without hardship, especially when it comes to jih˛d and hijrah. But it is easy for those for whom Allah makes it easy. ˜ose who have resolved to perform hijrah should purify their intentions, rely upon Allah , and make very much supplication. ˜ey should remember that despite the diˇculties of hijrah, {Whoever leaves his home as a muh˛jir to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him Œ his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah. And Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful} [An-Nis˛™: 100].D˛biq: What advice do you have to those Muslims who wish to perform hijrah to Libya?Abul-Mugh˝rah: We begin with advice to the Muslims in general to have zuhd towards the Duny˛ and its pleasures. ˜ey should not incline nor adhere to the Earth. ˜ey should be Ans˛r of Allah, perform hijrah, and strike the enemies of Allah. ˜e supporters of the religion should know, {And whoever performs hijrah for the cause of Allah will ˚nd on the earth many locations and abundance} [An-Nis˛™: 100]. We call them to march forth and incite them to support us.D˛biq: What advice do you have to the muh˛jir˝n in general, and to the muh˛jir˝n in Libya in particular?Abul-Mugh˝rah: My advice to the muh˛jir˝n in general is that they should not become proud by their hijrah nor should they consider their jih˛d a favor they have done for Allah. ˜ey should make their intentions sincere, for there were those who performed hijrah to the Prophet  for the sake of Duny˛ and a woman to marry, such as the man who was called ﬁMuh˛jir Umm Qays.ﬂ So we call you, our brother, to perform your hijrah for Allah and in support of His religion. Your path will be disturbed by diˇculties and great obstacles. ˜e actions are but by intention and comfort is not achieved by comfort.A group of Muslims and muj˜hid˛n declaring their bay™ah in Wil˜yat Tar˜bulusDestroying a shirk˛ tomb in the city of DarnahMuslims rescued Œ by Islamic State soldiers Œ from the mischief of armed gangs near Barqah64INTERVIEW65dabiqJubayr Ibn Nufayr  reported that Abud-Dard˛™  reported that he was with Allah™s Messenger  when he  looked up towards the sky and said, ﬁA time will come soon when knowledge is taken away from the people until they are no longer able to grasp any of it.ﬂ Ziy˛d Ibn Lab˝d al-Ans˛r˝  said, ﬁHow will it be ta-ken away from us while we have read the Qur™˛n, for by Allah, we will read it and have our women and chil-dren read it [in another narration: and have the child-ren of our children read it until Resurrection Day]?ﬂ He  said, ﬁMay your mother bereave you O Ziy˛d!

So take warning, O people of vision} [Al-Hashr: 2].˜e divided crusaders of the East and West thought them-selves safe in their jets as they cowardly bombarded the Muslims of the Khil˚fah. {˜ey will not ˛ght you all except within forti˛ed cities or from behind walls} [Al-Hashr: 14]. But Allah  decreed that punishment befall the warring crusaders from where they had not expected. ˜us, the blessed attacks against the Russians and the French were successfully executed despite the international intelligence war against the Islamic State. Both crusader nations had undoubtedly destroyed their homes with their own hands through their hostilities towards Islam, the Muslims, and the Muslim body of the Khil˚fah.On ﬁ30 September 2015,ﬂ after years of supporting the Nusayr˝ t˚gh˙t in the war against the Muslims of Sh˚m, Russia decided to participate directly with its own air force in the war. It was a rash decision of arrogance from Russia, as if it held that its wars against the Muslims of al-Qawq˚z were not enough oˆence. And so after having discovered a way to compromise the security at the Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport and resolving to bring down a plane belonging to a nation in the American-led Western coali-tion against the Islamic State, the target was changed to a Russian plane. A bomb was smuggled onto the airplane, leading to the deaths of 219 Russians and 5 other crusaders only a month after Russia™s thoughtless decision.A year earlier, on ﬁ19 September 2014,ﬂ France haughtily began executing airstrikes against the Khil˚fah. Like Russia, it was blinded by hubris, thinking that its geographical dis-tance from the lands of the Khil˚fah would protect it from the justice of the muj˚hid˝n. It also did not grasp that its mockery of the Messenger  would not be left unavenged. ˜us, the Islamic State dispatched its brave knights to wage war in the homelands of the wicked crusaders, leaving Par-is and its residents ﬁshocked and awed.ﬂ ˜e eight knights brought Paris down on its knees, after years of French con-ceit in the face of Islam. A nationwide state of emergency was declared as a result of the actions of eight men armed only with assault riˇes and explosive belts.And so revenge was exacted upon those who felt safe in the cockpits of their jets.Am˝rul-Mu™min˝n Ab˙ Bakr al-Husayn˝ al-Baghd˚d˝ (ha-˛dhahull˚h) said, ﬁBy Allah, we will take revenge! By Allah, we will take revenge! Even if it takes a while, we will take revenge, and every amount of harm against the Ummah will be responded to with multitudes more against the perpetrator. {And those who, when tyranny strikes them, they defend themselves} [Ash-Sh˙r˚: 39]. Soon, by Allah™s permission, a day will come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master, having honor, being revered, with his head raised high, and his dignity preserved. Anyone who dares to oˆend him will be disciplined, and any hand that reaches out to harm him will be cut oˆ. So let the world know that we are living today in a new era. Whoever was heedless must now be alert. Whoever was sleeping must ForewordThe nightmare in France has only begunThe coward Francois Hollandedaring raids in Paris3now awaken. Whoever was shocked and awed must com-prehend. ˜e Muslims today have a loud, thundering state-ment, and possess heavy boots. ˜ey have a statement that will cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism, and boots that will trample the idol of national-ism, destroy the idol of democracy, and uncover its deviant natureﬂ [A Message to the Mujahidin and the Muslim Um-mah in the Month of Ramadan].Yes, by Allah, the Khil˚fah will take revenge for any aggres-sion against its religion and people, sooner rather than lat-er. Let the arrogant know that the skies and the lands are Allah™s. {M˙sa said to his people, ﬁSeek help through Allah and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah. He caus-es to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the ˛nal outcome is for the righteous} [Al-A™r˚f: 128].So when will the crusaders end their hostilities towards Islam and the Muslims? When will they realize that the Khil˚fah is here to stay? When will they recognize that the solution to their pathetic turmoil is right before their blind-ed eyes? For until then, the just terror will continue to strike them to the core of their deadened hearts.On this occasion, we will not forget to commend the mar-tyred ﬁloneﬂ knights of the Khil˚fah who struck out against the k˚˛r and apostate enemies near them. ˜ese brave men were not content with merely hearing news about jih˚d battles, rather they distanced themselves from the traits of those who {would wish they were in the desert among the Bedouins, inquiring from afar about your news}, those who {if they were among you, they would not ˛ght except for a little} [Al-Ahz˚b: 20]. ˜ey did not use the obstacles laid down by the kuˆ˚r on the path to hijrah as an excuse to abandon jih˚d against the enemies. ˜ey did not use a younger age or lack of training as an excuse to be mere by-standers. ˜ey sacri˛ced their souls in the noblest of deeds in pursuit of Allah™s pleasure. We consider them such, and Allah is their judge.Amongst these brave knights of tawh˝d and jih˚d was ˛f-teen-year-old Farhad Khalil Mohammad Jabar, who on ﬁ2 October 2015ﬂ struck the crusaders of Australia and killed one of their personnel. ˜ereafter Faisal Mohammad carried the banner and his dagger to spear the crusaders of America on ﬁ4 November 2015,ﬂ spilling their ˛lthy blood in their insecure homeland. Earlier, on ﬁ10 October 2015,ﬂ sixteen-year-old Ish˚q Q˚sim Badr˚n grabbed his blade and pierced citizens of the accursed Jewish state, ˛lling the atmosphere with their screams. After Ish˚q, Muhannad Khal˝l al-‚Aqab˝ carried his own weapon into a high security train station on ﬁ18 October 2015ﬂ  and killed a soldier from an ﬁelite unitﬂ belonging to the Jewish army, causing the other coward-ly soldiers to retreat. And on ﬁ9 November 2015,ﬂ Anwar Abu Zeid Œ after repenting from his former occupation Œ attacked the American crusaders and their apostate allies, killing two American crusaders, two Jordanian apostates, and one South African crusader.˜ese are the deeds of those upon the methodology of the revived Khil˚fah. ˜ey will not let its enemies enjoy rest until enemy blood is spilled in revenge for the religion and the Ummah.So let every such muwahhid barred from hijrah purify him-self of the branches of lesser hypocrisy that hold him back from performing jih˚d in his location. Let him record his will, renew his bay™ah, carry the Khil˚fah banner, and strike the crusaders and their pagan and apostate allies wherever he can ˛nd them, even if he is alone. And he should remem-ber that {whoever relies upon Allah Œ then He is su˘cient for him} [At-Tal˚q: 3].And let the crusaders know that the Islamic State will re-main despite all their military arsenal. {Say, ﬁDo you await for us except one of the two best things while we await for you with punishment from Him-self or at our hands? So wait; indeed we, along with you, are waitingﬂ} [At-Tawbah: 52].FOREWORDEXCLUSIVE - Passports belonging to dead crusaders obtained by the EXCLUSIVE - Image of the IED used to bring down the Russian airliner5As the Sahwah fever spreads through the ranks of al-Q˚™idah from Sh˚m to its other branches, it is important to study the relationship between the other branches and regional apostate parties, as these relationships in addition to the irj˚™ and hizbiyyah of al-Q˚™idah™s leadership are the crucial driv-ing force in converting al-Q˚™idah branches from parties resisting the American-led crusades into hardcore sahw˚t.In Khur˚s˚n, al-Q˚™idah is with the Taliban factions who announced their adoption of nationalism and resistance to-wards wal˚™ and bar˚™, lied to the Ummah by attributing their deviant declarations to the deceased Mull˚ ‚Umar, and shamelessly ˇaunted their brotherhood with the apostate taw˚gh˝t and the R˚˛dah. In India, they are the allies of the nationalist Kashmir factions whose advances and with-drawals are only by the order of the apostate Pakistani army. In North Africa, they are the allies of the Libyan factions who partook in the religion of democracy in the name of ﬁIslam.ﬂAnd in Yemen, one of the top allies of al-Q˚™idah Œ after the ‚Abd Rabbuh battalions, the ﬁIsl˚hﬂ parliamentarians, and the pro-Saudi ﬁSala˛yyahﬂ of Dammaj and Ma™rib Œ is the ﬁHadhrami Domestic Council.ﬂ According to the introduc-tion found on the council™s o˘cial website, ﬁ˜e Hadhrami Domestic Council in the city of al-Mukall˚ Œ the capital of Hadramawt Œ was formed and then announced on Mon-day, 13 April 2015, to be an authority for administering the aˆairs of the Hadramawt capital city of al-Mukall˚ af-ter being granted control over it by those who collapsed it Œ Ans˚r ash-Shar˝™ah, ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™1 Œ on 2 April 2015.2 ˜e Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed by a ˛ne selection of the sincere men of Hadramawt in-cluding religious scholars, prominent ˛gures, tribal ˛gures, social ˛gures, businessmen, academics, engineers, media professionals, and o˘cers in the army and security forces. ˜ey shouldered their historical responsibility at a crucial moment for the sake of Hadramawt. ˜ey did not abandon it to an unknown future. ˜ey kept it from being a target of foreign forces, lack of authority and security, theft, de-struction, and chaos. ˜is is from the most important goals for which the Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed, in addition to shouldering the responsibility of administering the aˆairs of the city with the aid of the citizens and by pre-serving its security and stability and securing the continued delivery of necessary services including water, food supplies, electricity, medical care, waste management, education, and other services. ˜e council also has high hopes in its citizens contributing towards achieving these noble goals and nor-malizing public life, each person in his realm of work and specialization, and that they will unite their ranks for the 1 Editor™s Note: ﬁ˜e Sons of Hadramawtﬂ is the new name used by the Yemeni branch of al-Q˚™idah as it dodges its former name ﬁAns˚r ash-Shar˝™ah.ﬂ2 Editor™s Note: ˜e coordinated handover of al-Mukall˚ by al-Q˚™idah to this council was mentioned in D˚biq, issue 10, pages 67-68.THE ALLIES OF AL-Q˜˚IDAH IN YEMEN56sake of Hadramawt as it needs all its sons to organize their aˆairs and not wait for others to do so.ﬂ˜is clari˛es that al-Mukall˚ is run by the Hadhrami Do-mestic Council, that the council has blatant apostates (o˘-cers in both the army and security forces) amongst its ranks, and that al-Q˚™idah granted the council power after over-running the city.In the ˛rst press release made by this council on ﬁ13 April 2015,ﬂ only nine days after al-Mukall˚ was overrun by al-Q˚™idah, they said, ﬁO free sons of Hadramawt, in light of the painful circumstances that the country in general faces, including the province of Hadramawt, especially its capital al-Mukall˚, the Council of the Scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah, the tribal elders, and a party of prominent ˛gures and se-niors took the initiative to repair the lands and protect them from slipping into bloody conˇicts. A meeting occurred in which the Hadhrami Domestic Council was formed to be-come an authority in administering the aˆairs of the pro-vincial capital and in coordination with and under the su-pervision of the governor of Hadramawt Province, Dr. ‚dil Muhammad B˚ham˝d. With success granted by Allah, the council reached an agreement with the Sons of Hadramawt consisting of the following: First, they have to hand over all the public utilities and the administration of them to the Hadhrami Domestic Council. It is also the right of the Domestic Council to appoint whom it wishes as its head. Second, the Domestic Council is responsible for adminis-trating the matter of public security and its stations. ˜ird, what is needed to facilitate the job of the Council and ad-minister services will be provided by the Sons of Hadra-mawt to the Domestic Council, as agreed by both sides – ˜e council calls – all the directors of o˘ces and all the civil and security bodies to pursue their work under the su-pervision of the council – ˜e council also commends the eˆorts of Operation Decisive Storm under the leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council to deter the aggression of the Houthis and their allies.ﬂIn this ˛rst press release, they blatantly ˇaunt their contin-ued relationship with the t˚gh˙t regime of ‚Abd Rabbuh, they call on the apostates of the security bodies to carry on in their work, and they ˇatter the apostate taw˚gh˝t of the Arabian Peninsula, only nine days after al-Q˚™idah overran al-Mukall˚!In a press release on ﬁ23 May 2015,ﬂ they eulogize the t˚gh˙t Ahmad B˚h˚j, ﬁgovernorﬂ of the province of Shabwah un-der the ‚Abd Rabbuh murtadd regime, after he was killed ˛ghting the murtadd R˚˛dah.In a press release on ﬁ16 June 2015,ﬂ they said, ﬁOn the oc-casion of the arrival of the blessed month of Ramad˚n, the leaders and members of the Hadhrami Domestic Council – send special greetings and great thanks to the Servant of the Noble Haramayn and all the leaders of the Gulf states.ﬂIn a press release on ﬁ4 September 2015,ﬂ they said, ﬁWe will not miss the opportunity in this declaration to oˆer condolences to our brothers in the coalition of Arab nations with respect to the victims resulting from a treacherous at-tack that led to the deaths of sixty Emirati, Saudi, and Bah-raini soldiers. We ask Allah  to accept them as shuhad˚™ as they defended their nations – We convey to them the 7condolences of the people of Hadramawt for the families of the shuhad˚™ and their hope for their wounded to quickly recover.ﬂOn ﬁ15 June 2015,ﬂ they released an article in which they respond to their opposition. In the piece, they said, ﬁHow can it be believed that the Domestic Council is run by al-Q˚™idah when the Council recognizes the legitimacy of ‚Abd Rabbuh whereas al-Q˚™idah considers him to be a t˚gh˙t?ﬂOn their website, they regularly report their relations with top o˘cials from the ‚Abd Rabbuh regime including those from the Finance Ministry, the Education Ministry, the Central Bank, and the Defense Ministry, as well as the gov-ernors of various provinces. ˜ey also report on ﬁ24 April 2015ﬂ their dispatching of an o˘cial delegation to ﬁSau-diﬂ Arabia to meet with Saudi o˘cials and both the prime minister and vice president of the ‚Abd Rabbuh regime in an eˆort to strengthen the relationship between the council and the Saudi and Yemeni regimes.In an announcement released on ﬁ21 April 2015,ﬂ the council said, ﬁSince – the collapse of all the institutions of the state, army, and security, and the control of those who call themselves ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™ over the aˆairs of the provincial capital, and after constant communication with the governor of the province of Hadramawt – the scholars, tribal elders, and notables placed their exhaustive eˆorts into convincing ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™ of the danger of their remaining in control of the political o˘ces of the government and its other buildings, something that could lead to regional and international military interfer-ence whose outcome would be disastrous for the people and land. ˜ese eˆorts resulted in an agreement decreeing the handover of all government facilities and public security centers to a domestic Hadhrami council formed by scholars and tribal nobles –ﬂ˜ey go on to say, ﬁ˜e brother, the governor of the Hadra-mawt province, blessed this agreement; rather he initially agreed to be the head of the council. He later proposed be-ing a coordinator and supervisor over the council. After a few days, the armed forces defending the airport, ad-Dab-bah, Brigade 27, and Air force Brigade 190 all withdrew. It is not true that the Domestic Hadhrami Council received these camps and handed them over to ‚˜e Sons of Hadra-mawt.™ Rather, the ‚Sons of Hadramawt™ overran them ˛rst. Because of these events, an emergency meeting was held by the Domestic Council on 29/6/1436AH coinciding with 18 April 2015. ˜e following resolutions were made there:ﬂﬁFirst resolution: ˜e negotiations between the Domestic Council and ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™ will continue. ˜e seizing of control over the public facilities and the responsi-bility to administer the aˆairs of the provincial capital will not be complete until ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™ abide by the following conditions. ˜ey must: A) Gradually hand over all the government facilities to the Domestic Coun-cil. B) Hand over the seaport, the airport, and the military camps to the Domestic Council. C) Hand over su˘cient amounts and su˘cient types of vehicles, weapons, and mu-nitions (in accordance with the demands of the council™s security committee) to enable the achievement of the coun-cil™s duties in maintaining public security and military posts. D) Return at least two billion riyals from the money that was taken from the Central Bank to the Domestic Council for the council to manage the aˆairs of the province. E) Not execute arrests or house raids after the Domestic Coun-cil takes authority except if it is proven that an individual works against the security of the province.ﬂﬁ˜e second resolution: Communication with the President and Vice President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, and the governor of the province will continue until a declara-tion is released in which they announce their support of the Domestic Council so as to achieve security, stability, and normalization of aˆairs in Hadramawt–ﬂﬁ˜e results of the negotiations with ‚˜e Sons of Hadra-mawt™ were as follows: ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™ agreed to hand over the public facilities and the administration of these facilities whenever the Domestic Council requests so. ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™ agreed to hand over the sea-port, the airport, and the military camps, except for Brigade 27, to the Domestic Council – ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™ agreed to provide the Domestic Council with a su˘cient amount of vehicles, weapons, emergency vehicles, and po-lice vehicles, so as to facilitate the job of the council™s secu-rity committee – ‚˜e Sons of Hadramawt™ agreed to stop carrying out any arrests or house raids after the Domestic Council takes authority of the city unless the danger of an individual against the security of Hadramawt is certain.ﬂIt becomes clear from these various press releases and dec-larations that the council is a project whose mission is to reestablish the ‚Abd Rabbuh regime in Hadramawt while taking advantage of the partisanship, irj˚™, and foolishness of the Yemeni branch of al-Q˚™idah. After expelling a t˚gh˙t in power, al-Q˚™idah refused to take control of the land and rule it by Shar˝™ah themselves and instead handed it over to a selection of Ikhw˚n, Saudi supporters, grave worship-pers, and former parliament, military, and security o˘cials! Meanwhile, as their relationship with the nationalist resis-tance grows, their enmity towards the Islamic State surges. ˜ey are not able to fathom takf˝r and war against both the R˚˛d˝ Houthis and the murtadd regime forces together. And if matters carry on as they had in Sh˚m, the common enemy between the Yemeni Q˚™idah and the nationalist resistance will become the Khil˚fah. May Allah guide the soldiers in the ranks of al-Q˚™idah out of the ranks of parti-sanship and into the ranks of the Jam˚™ah before they follow the footsteps of the apostate Jawl˚n˝ front.THE ALLIES OF AL-Q˜˚IDAH IN YEMEN89[˜is article was ˛rst published in ﬁSawtul-Jih˚d,ﬂ former magazine of al-Q˚™idah in the Arabian Peninsula (before the partisan Yemeni branch). ˜e author of the piece  did not su˘ce with seeking knowledge and training, but instead led al˙l until he achieved shah˚dah for Allah™s sake. May Allah accept him, reward him, and bless him.]I am pleased to present my advice to the muj˚hid˝n in par-ticular, and the Muslims in general through ﬁSawtul-Jih˚dﬂ magazine.˜e ˛rst piece of advice Œ following my advice to fear Allah and be mindful of Him Œ is to listen to and obey those whom Allah has given authority over the aˆairs of the mu-j˚hid˝n.˜e Uy the treacherous, apostate rulers and leaders who have even violated the rights of Allah in addition to the rights of His creation. And it is known that the authority of these rulers is invalid, and that it is obligatory to oppose them and wage war against them. But what is meant by listening and obeying here is in reference to those whom Allah has given authority over the aˆairs of jih˚d [and now, the Khil˚fah]. ˜is is a very important and very serious matter, which the Wise legisla-tor has urged. And His Messenger  has made disobedi-ence of one™s leader similar to disobedience of the Prophet . Listening and obeying is from unity, cooperation, and strength, in contrast with quarrelling, disunity, and dis-agreement.Quarrelling and disagreement in jih˚d is considered a means of failure and defeat. {And do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. Indeed, Allah is with the patient} [Al-Anf˚l: 46].He who studies history and S˝rah sees that disobeying the 9ADVICE TO THE MUJ˜HID˛N: LISTEN AND OBEY10leader Œ in any form Œ has a severe, adverse consequence, and the best example of that is what happened to the Sah˚-bah in the Battle of Uhud when they disobeyed the Prophet  and as a result, the Muslim army suˆered a setback and calamity, including many of the best Sah˚bah being killed, and the Prophet and a number of other Sah˚bah being wounded. ˜is was all the result of disobeying the leader, the Prophet .And how many times has a leader been disobeyed in some of the lands and arenas of jih˚d, and the price paid as a re-sult was calamity and tribulation that included blood being spilled and lives being lost, for disobeying the leader is not merely a sin that aˆects the sinner alone. Rather, it aˆects the entire group, and most of the time the entire army.How many times has a muj˚hid brother been ordered by his leader not to go to a certain area, but he disobeys the leader and as a result he lands in captivity!And how many times has a brother disobeyed the leader with respect to security measures and precautions, and as a result he and a group of his brothers land in captivity!˜ere are many instances where a group of brothers were taken captive or arrested because one of them disobeyed the security precautions they were instructed with by the am˝r.One of the many small examples mentioned in this regard is an incident that was related to me by one of the broth-ers about a man who wanted to join the training camps in Afghanistan. ˜e person responsible for his departure gave him instructions not to call his family until he reached Pa-kistan. But the brother disobeyed this order and called his family from the airport in his country just before boarding the plane. Immediately, his family hastened to speak to the airport o˘cials and managed to catch him before the plane took oˆ. So he paid the price of disobedience by being de-prived of preparing for and undertaking jih˚d for Allah™s cause!˜ere are many such incidents, but here I would like to advise the brothers who have refused to live a life of humili-ation and have overcome their desires and lusts, to fasten on themselves the bridle of listening to and obeying the leaders in everything big and small, for obedience is in everything except in sin. And if the leader™s order is an issue of ijti-h˚d where there are two or more legitimate opinions and the leader has adopted one of the opinions Œ regardless of whether it is the more correct or the less correct opinion Œ it is obligatory to yield to the opinion he has chosen and sub-mit to his order, because the issue is an issue of ijtih˚d and there is no denunciation in that.And beware of looking for loopholes to avoid obeying the order to the letter, as they are the causes of grief and calam-ity. Whenever someone wants to disobey the leader, if he were to look for an excuse for himself he would ˛nd it. So those who disobeyed the Prophet  in the Battle of Uhud, their excuse was that the battle was over and there was no longer any point in remaining on the archers™ mountain, and so on and so forth– So do not look for excuses when you are thinking of disobeying the order, but rather compel yourself to follow the order and not overstep it.It is sad to see that the people of falsehood and the armies of the taw˚gh˝t listen and obey and that they are relatively disciplined. You would see one of them committing a sin - even committing kufr - and if he were asked about it he would foolishly say, ﬁI™m a slave who™s been given orders!ﬂWhereas you ˛nd that listening to and obeying the lead-er [who does not order with sin] is a matter that is some-what lost and weak when it comes to the muj˚hid˝n. Wall˚hul-Musta™˚n–It is obligatory on you, my noble brother, to harshly de-nounce anyone who disobeys the leader, and to assist your leader and your brothers in preventing any disobedience and mistake that the Ummah and the muj˚hid˝n would pay the price for.And know, O blessed one, that listening and obeying is from being humble towards the believers, and that to vio-late this is to be harsh on the believers!I conclude my advice with the following poetry:Listen to my truthful advice, for indeed I want good and bene˛t for you, O my brother.Your obedience to your leader is an essential necessity, and whoever disobeys his order commits a sin.To listen to and obey the leader is to listen to the com-mand of Muhammad, the conveyer of glad tidings.As for opposing the command and disobeying, then it is a sin against the Judge (Allah).And it is the foundation of weakness and defeat, and leads to corrupt opinions and loss of resolve.And what occurred to the Sah˚bah in the Battle of Uhud is forever a lesson for every believer.So adhere to and be diligent in obedience and don™t get tired. Listen both in times of dislike and delight,Unless the leader™s order is against the Shar˝™ah, for there is no obedience to the leader in such.I ask Allah to help both me and you, my brother, in lis-tening and obeying, and to not to make us a cause for any harm to befall our brothers through our sins, and to forgive us if we forget or make mistakes.11Since the de-ﬁIslamizationﬂ of the nationalist ﬁIslamicﬂ sah-w˚t began Œ those factions having loyalty towards the Arab and Turkish taw˚gh˝t Œ not a month passes without a decla-ration of nationalism and democracy being released by the allies of al-Q˚™idah in Sh˚m. ˜e taw˚gh˝t are ordered by the crusaders to pressure the sahw˚t into announcing more and more concessions for continued military and non-military aid to reach them as well as for them to gain international political support and air cover from the crusaders.˜e concessions will not end, and thus their apostasy be-comes more and more blatant for none to doubt, not even the most deviant Murji™.1 It™s reached the point that even some within the Jawl˚n˝ front realized its allies were too shameless for the Jawl˚n˝ front to continue to openly support.2 And so former alliances were scaled back, downplayed, or ignored, reaching the point that the Jawl˚n˝ front publically coordi-nated a handover of their frontline posts to the Sh˚miyyah Front, an open ally of the American crusaders and Turkish taw˚gh˝t. It was not a mere withdrawal brought about by nonexistent military pressure but a coordinated handover by the Jawl˚n˝ front leadership documented in photos released by their close ally. ˜is ﬁwithdrawalﬂ was meant to present an image to the Jawl˚n˝ front ﬁmuh˚jir˝nﬂ that their leader-ship does not cooperate with the agents of America. 1 Although the reality of the nationalist factions was always known by the leadership of the jih˚d claimants, they used the claims of the Murji™ah to treat the apostate and hypocritical factions as Muslims and to justify their alliance with them against the Islamic State.

We welcome the call to start a political process that leads to a political transition according to the Geneva Communi-qué that stipulates establishing a transitional governing body that starts functioning as soon as an agreement on a solution is reached, and thus, performing all executive authorities, in-cluding those of the President of the Republic.ﬂﬁ2.

We emphasize the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution 2165 for the year 2014 that allows all parties in the Syrian conˇict to convey the humanitarian aid immediately and without any obstacles, so as to deliver such aid directly to the people.ﬂﬁ5. We reject overlooking and being silent about the terror-ist groups that the Assad regime summoned to Syria and embraced, while they actually exercise genocide and forced displacements of population as well as introducing demo-graphic change in Syria; such groups include the sectarian militias, the Iranian Republican Guards and the Lebanese Hezbollah. We call for listing these groups on the Terrorism Lists.ﬂﬁ6. Respecting the will of the Syrian people; as the Syrians are the sole beholders of the power for founding the Consti-tution of the future Syria and approving each of its articles. ˜is means that there should be no prior principles imposed on the people as a way for con˛scating their free will.ﬂﬁ7. We call for excluding Iran from any consultations con-cerning the Syrian cause, as Iran is truly red-handed with the blood of the Syrians, being a supporter of the terrorist militias, as well as acting to ignite sectarian strife among the Syrian people, in addition to the fact that Iran does not rec-ognize the Geneva Communiqué as a reference (though this Communiqué has been fully supported by the UN Security Council resolution 2118).ﬂﬁ8. We emphasize the continuity of the service-providing State institutions as a necessary and vital issue. And yet, we reject the continuity of the works of the army and security institutions. We call for dissolving the security apparatus and restructuring the army and the judiciary.ﬂﬁ9. ˜e UN Security Council stated that it is calling for holding political negotiations and achieving political tran-sition on the basis of Geneva Communiqué. ˜e establish-ment of a transitional governing body has been very clear and explicit in the Communiqué. And thus, we call the UN Envoy to engage directly into the implementation of the Geneva Communiqué in a manner that is surrounded with regional and international guarantees; all without re-verting to any preempted measures or committees formed that would consume time and lead to the rendering of the Geneva Communiqué void of content.ﬂﬁ10. We emphasize the necessity of having real guaran-tees that obligate to all parties to implement whatever is agreed upon; as the Syrian regime has been accustomed to non-commitment to all resolutions throughout the past ˛ve years.ﬂﬁ11. ˜e explicit grave Russian intervention on Syrian ter-ritory is undermining the eˆorts exerted to reach a political solution.ﬂﬁ12.

Similarly, any attempt to solve the important issues such as reconstruction, combatting ter-rorism, achieving domestic security and peace, and estab-lishing a constitutional system, while not proceeding from the ˛xed principles of our great people will not be accepted by the Syrians, because doing so only dwarfs their cause and examines the symptoms while ignoring the root of the prob-lem. Although, we consider that every eˆort provided to save Syria to be an appreciated eˆort, we believe that delay-ing the decision on the major issue Œ which is the departure of al-Asad and his militias, the establishment of a united, independent, national, Syrian state Œ without guaranteeing any serious promises in this regards, will only increase the complexity of the problem and the depths of the wounds. ˜e Security Council Œ which is responsible legally, political-ly, and morally to preserve world peace Œ has failed to defend the Syrian people, contribute in achieving their noble goals, and prevent the occurrence of massacres carried out against them. ˜is is while we see attempts to rehabilitate the regime, even serious endeavors to make it a part of the present and future of Syria. We also see the Security Council ignoring the terrifying massacres that occurred and continue to oc-cur before and after the presidential statement. ˜e national forces who signed this document rea˘rm their adherence to the ˛xed principles of the Syrian people in their glorious revolution and consider that any transgression against these principles to be negligence towards the rights of the Syrians, disdain of their blood and sacri˛ce, and an eˆort that will never succeed, because it assumes and enforces a foundation that is rejected legally, politically, and morally.ﬂ˜is document was signed by the major factions allied to the Jawl˚n˝ front. ˜ese factions include ﬁFree Syrian Armyﬂ fac-tions, ﬁHarakat N˙r ad-D˝n Zink˝,ﬂ the ﬁSh˚miyyah Front,ﬂ ﬁFaylaq ash-Sh˚m,ﬂ ﬁJaysh al-Muj˚hid˝n,ﬂ and ﬁAl-Ittih˚d al-Isl˚m˝ li Ajn˚d ash-Sh˚m.ﬂ It was also signed by the secu-larist Syrian National Council, the regional provincial coun-cils belonging to the secularist Syrian National Coalition, Kh˚lid Khawjah (head of the Syrian National Coalition), ‚Abdul-Jabb˚r al-‚Ak˝d˝ (a former regime colonel, now an ally of the atheist PKK), and even George Sabra and Michel Kilo (Christian opposition politicians). Maybe the strangest point in this declaration is the ˛rst point, as Bashar al-Asad is a murtadd t˚gh˙t belonging to the apostate Nusayr˝ sect and apostate Baath party; it is an obligation to kill him even if he militia, etc.) and between the muh˚jir muj˚hid˝n (the muh˚jir˝n of the Islamic State). ˜e R˚˛dah are apostates even if they are ﬁfellow Syrians,ﬂ and the muh˚jir is a Muslim even if he had been a Christian American before his Islam. See D˚biq, issue 8, pages 3-11.THE ALLIES OF AL-Q˜˚IDAH IN SH˜M: THE END14were never to have killed a single Muslim. How much more so is it obligatory after all the massacres he™s committed! His evil is so clear-cut it does not require a trial to prove his apos-tasy and crimes except in the religion of the crusaders whom these nationalists seek to please.˜is was followed by a third document released on ﬁ3 Octo-ber 2015.ﬂ In it, they say:ﬁPolitical o˘ces of the undersigned rebel factions and the Syrian Coalition™s political committee held a meeting and thoroughly studied the proposals put forward by the UN envoy Staˆan de Mistura, namely the ‚Working groups™ ini-tiative. After in-depth reviewing of the regional and inter-national reality engul˛ng the Syrian arena as well as recent sensitive developments with profound ˛eld and political in-ˇuence, and out of our concern for the possibility of launch-ing a new failed political process costing Syrians even more thousands of lives, and more destruction to the remnants of the country‚s infrastructure, we a˘rm the following points:ﬂﬁFirst: Participants in the meeting emphasize their commit-ment to reaching a political solution to achieve the goals of the revolution, preserve the identity of the Syrian people and end their suˆering. ˜is political process however must en-sure that the current regime is not reproduced or that its head and pillars, whose hands are stained with the blood of Syrians, are not given any role in the transitional political process or in Syria™s future.ﬂﬁSecond: While forces of the revolution and the opposition have always dealt fully positive with the UN envoy despite the absence of any practical results on the ground, they em-phasize they will continue to positively deal with the United Nations in order to achieve the interests of the Syrian peo-ple.ﬂﬁ˜ird: ˜e Syrian people have completely lost con˛dence in the ability of the international community to support their cause after ˛ve years of regime crimes committed against them with Iranian military support, Russian political coverage and a legitimacy that the international communi-ty still insists on providing to the murderous regime. ˜e current popular outrage must be taken into account in any political process which must be preceded by real steps to win the con˛dence of the Syrian people. ˜e most important of these steps is to explicitly declare that the head of the regime and its pillars cannot be given any role to play in the political process.ﬂﬁFourth: Bashar al-Assad has no place in any political pro-cess depending on the following legal and practical reasons: Bashar al-Assad inherited power in an entirely illegal way. Bashar al-Assad became a war criminal the moment he be-gan killing Syrians who peacefully demanded their rights. He used illegal chemical weapons against innocent civilians. ˜ese crimes have been documented by neutral internation-al organizations to prevent any doubt in the matter. Bashar al-Assad and his regime have shown utmost reluctance to engage in any political process, have not abided by any de-clared truces, and have shown non-cooperation with the in-ternational community purely with humanitarian issues. All of this has left him with no credibility or con˛dence. While Bashar al-Assad and his regime have failed in their alleged war against ISIS or to achieve any intellectual or ˛eld vic-tory against this extremist organization, there is compelling evidence on full coordination between the two sides and the role Assad™s regime plays in the emergence of ISIS.6 Bashar al-Assad has opened the doors of Syria to foreign militias who commit the worst sectarian massacres at the same time 6 Editor™s Note: ˜ere is no cooperation between the Islamic State and the Nusayr˝ regime except in the lies of those who have been intoxi-cated by conspiracy theory shirk. ˜e Islamic State does not cooperate with the Nusayriyyah, rather it massacres them and their forces as it has done in the former regime military encampments in Wil˚yat ar-Raqqah, Tadmur, and as-Sukhnah. It is battling them ˛ercely in Halab, Hims, Ham˚h, al-Barakah, and al-Khayr. ˜e Nusayr˝ jets regularly target Is-lamic State frontlines, buildings, ˛ghters, and subjects in ar-Raqqah, al-B˚b, al-May˚d˝n, and elsewhere. But partisanship, nationalism, and conspiracy theory shirk is what drives the sahw˚t into fabricating claims of cooperation, because the sahw˚t themselves are used to cooperating and being slaves of the crusaders and taw˚gh˝t, they imagine that every entity must also be cooperating with and enslaved by other crusaders and taw˚gh˝t, as wal˚™ and bar˚™ is a nonexistent creed in the dead hearts of the sahw˚t. See also D˚biq, issue 9, ﬁConspiracy ˜eory Shirk,ﬂ pages 14-19.The Sahwah places trust in Staffan cosies up to him15as fuelling sectarian rhetoric, which deprives him of any el-igibility to participate in any political process that aims to unite the country. Finally, Bashar al-Assad has handed over Syria to Iranian and Russian invaders, thus committing an unforgivable act of betrayal to the country™s history, its future and dignity.ﬂﬁFifth: We consider that dissolving the security agencies and the restructuring of the military institution directly respon-sible for killing Syrians an essential item for any political solution. ˜is beleaguered and crumbling military institu-tion has turned into sectarian militias led by Iran. It cannot therefore form the nucleus of a national army, nor can it be trusted by the Syrian people to restore security and stability to the country.ﬂﬁSixth: ˜e formation of a transitional governing body is a process of full transfer of power in which Bashar al-Assad and pillars of his regime have no place. We emphasize the need to preserve state institutions and prevent their disinte-gration as they belong to the Syrian people, and to prevent the country from sliding into more chaos.ﬂﬁSeventh: We consider that proposing the ‚Working groups™ initiative ignores the majority of the relevant United Nations resolutions on Syria, particularly resolutions 2118, 2165 and 2139. ˜is initiative is in fact a complicated political process that requires con˛dence-building between the Syrian people on the one hand and the party that will sponsor the political process, namely the United Nations. Con˛dence-building can only be achieved through the implementation of the above-mentioned UN resolutions that the Syrian regime has so far disabled them.ﬂﬁEighth: We consider that the ‚Working groups™ initiative in its current form and its unclear mechanisms provides the perfect environment to reproduce the regime. ˜ese ‚Work-ing groups™ must instead be based on clear principles regard-ing standards for selecting the participants in these groups and the ˛nal vision for the solution.ﬂﬁNinth: We condemn Russia™s direct military escalation in Syria and consider the Syrian regime fully responsible as it has turned Syria into a hotbed for foreign intervention. ˜e silence of the international community also bears responsi-bility for this escalation and represents a point of no return in the relationship between the Syrian people and Russia. ˜is escalation clearly shows that Russia is not serious or sin-cere in its commitment to the political process, and that it has never been a honest mediator but a party to the conˇict and a key ally of the criminal regime.ﬂﬁTenth: While forces of the revolution and its institutions rea˘rm commitment to our people, we vow to exert the ut-most eˆorts to close ranks and correct previous mistakes. We also vow that the revolution will remain faithful to its princi-ples and the blood of its fallen heroes, and that we will strike a balance between achieving our objectives and safeguarding our fundamental principles. We also pledge to alleviate the suˆering of our people, expedite victory and to dedicate our political and military capabilities for this purpose.ﬂﬁAccordingly, the ‚Working groups™ initiative in its current form is unacceptable neither practically nor legally unless the above-mentioned points are taken into consideration and the ambiguities shaping the mechanisms of this initiative are resolved.ﬂ˜is deviant declaration reeking of nationalism and democ-racy was signed again by the major allies of the Jawl˚n˝ front in Sh˚m including ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚m.ﬂ It was equally signed by the Syrian National Coalition (the t˚gh˙t ﬁSyrian Interim Governmentﬂ) and some of the factions allied to the PKK atheists. Again, there is no such thing as wal˚™ and bar˚™ in the creed of these factions, which is the reality of all the na-tionalist ﬁIslamicﬂ factions allied to the Jawl˚n˝ front. ˜ey are apostate parties that have no religion except factional interests. If the success of their faction or the preservation of their leadership necessitates worshipping the United Na-tions, democracy, or nationalism, then they worship these idols. Because they need to attract naïve ˛ghters, they oˆer the occasional ﬁIslamicﬂ message domestically or quote some verses of the Qur™˚n here or there. However, the end mission is the establishment of a nationalist, democratic t˚gh˙t. For this reason, one of the ﬁjih˚d˝ﬂ allies of the Jawl˚n˝ front Œ ﬁJund al-Aqs˚ﬂ Œ could no longer tolerate the condition of the factions and released a statement announcing its with-drawal from ﬁJaysh al-Fath.ﬂ ˜ey explained the reason for their decision as follows:ﬁOur recent withdrawal from Jaysh al-Fath has a number of reasons. A) Some of the factions in Jaysh al-Fath support missions contradicting the Islamic Shar˝™ah. ˜is is clear in the last De Mistura statement released in which the sixth clause dictates: ‚Respecting the will of the Syrian people; as the Syrians are the sole beholders of the power for founding the Constitution of the future Syria and approving each of its articles. ˜is means that there should be no prior princi-THE ALLIES OF AL-Q˜˚IDAH IN SH˜M: THE ENDNations are yet another pillar of hope for the Sahwah16ples imposed on the people as a way for con˛scating their free will™! ˜ere were other clauses in the document that we consider to oppose the Shar˝™ah including the welcoming of Turkish intervention and other defeatist statements.ﬂ ˜ey then announce their willingness to return to ﬁJaysh al-Fathﬂ under some conditions, including, ﬁAll the factions of Jaysh al-Fath have to clarify openly and clearly their position to-wards all the missions contradicting the implementation of Shar˝™ah.ﬂ Although their statement fell short of declaring war against these j˚hil˝ factions, it does show that the matter has become so clear it should no longer require any more clari˛cation from D˚biq.As for the Jawl˚n˝ front, will they now repent from their treachery and apostasy and distance themselves from their nationalist ﬁIslamicﬂ allies whom they allied together with against the Islamic State despite knowing very well of the na-tionalist apostasy within these factions? Will they wage war against them and return to the ranks of the Islamic State? It seems that their partisanship and love for leadership has outdone them, and they will continue to remain in the ranks of the Sahwah until their own allies turn on them. And Allah knows best.Finally, it is the apostate Sahwah coalition Œ the nationalist factions and their jih˚d claimant allies Œ and their likes inside and outside of Sh˚m who united against the Islamic State that Shaykh Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Adn˚n˝ (ha˛dhahull˚h) pronounced takf˝r upon when he said, ﬁWe likewise renew our call to the soldiers of the factions in Sh˚m and Libya. We call on them to think long before embarking to ˛ght the Islamic State, which rules by that which Allah revealed. Remember, O yy ˛tnah, before embarking to ˛ght the Islamic State, that there is no place on the face of the Earth where the Shar˝™ah of Allah is implemented and the rule is entirely for Allah except for the lands of the Is-lamic State. Remember that if you were able to capture one hand span, one village, or one city from it, the law of Allah in that area would be replaced with the laws of men. ˜en ask yourself, ‚What is the ruling on someone who replaces or is a cause for the replacement of the law of Allah with the law of man?™ Yes, you commit kufr by such. So beware, for by ˛ghting the Islamic State you fall into kufr whether you real-ize it or notﬂ [O Our People Respond to the Caller of Allah].In a later address, he reiterated that the Islamic State does not diˆerentiate between their various individual intentions. ˜is is because these factions have entered into a single al-liance in which the upper hand is for nationalist apostasy, a reality not hidden now from their lowest-ranking soldiers. Accordingly, no matter how much some of them empha-size an ﬁintentionﬂ to implement the ﬁShar˝™ah,ﬂ supremacy within their alliance against the Islamic State is certainly not for the Shar˝™ah, rather it is for those who forcefully resist the Shar˝™ah and most of its clear-cut laws including mani-festation of wal˚™ and bar˚™, the implementation of hud˙d, and the performance of hisbah (commanding the good and forbidding the evil). ˜us, their alliance is one of apostasy, and the individual is not excused due to his supposedly good intention.˜erefore, Shaykh Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Adn˚n˝ said, ﬁAs for you, O factions of apostasy and treachery, O factions of disgrace everywhere, O scum. Is it not time you learn a les-son from your predecessors from amongst the factions all the long years in Iraq? Did you not bene˛t from the lessons you were taught in Sh˚m? – By Allah™s permission, we are coming to you (O soldiers of the factions). And by Allah, we hold you as pitiful. So take these words from us and under-stand them. – We know that your intentions, goals, and conditions are various. Some of you ˛ght us because of our religion, as you don™t want an Islamic state, out of dislike for the law of Allah, in support of the taw˚gh˝t, and while being content with manmade laws. ˜ese are a small selection of you. Many of you ˛ght us despite claiming to want imple-mentation of the law of Allah. But they have deviated and not found the correct path. Some of you ˛ght us thinking we are a barbaric enemy against the Muslims. Others ˛ght for the sake of the Duny˚ or a salary from the factions. Oth-ers ˛ght out of pride and bravery. And others have other various forms of intentions and evil. But know that we do not diˆerentiate between these intents and goals and that our ruling upon you after overpowering you is one: a bullet splitting the head or a sharp knife inside the neckﬂ [Say to ˜ose Who Disbelieve, ﬁYou Will Be Overcomeﬂ].If those holding supposedly good intentions were truthful, they would abandon the Sahwah alliance, repent from their apostasy, pronounce takf˝r upon their former allies, and wage war against them, not against the Islamic State. Shaykh Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Adn˚n˝ advised the Sahwah soldiers, ﬁBy Al-lah™s permission, O soldiers of the factions, we are coming to wherever you might be even if after some time. We did not come initially for you, so do not stand in the face of the muj˚hid˝n. Whoever throws his weapons aside and repents is safe. Whoever sits in the masjid and repents is safe. Who-ever enters his home, closes his door, and repents, is safe. Whoever from the factions and brigades abandons the war against us and repents is safe. ˜ey are safe concerning their lives and wealth despite the severity of their former enmity towards the muj˚hid˝n and despite the amount of transgres-sion they™d committed before. O Allah, we have conveyed, so witnessﬂ [Say to ˜ose Who Disbelieve, ﬁYou Will Be Overcomeﬂ].May Allah  grant the muj˚hid˝n victory in Sh˚m even if the crusaders, the taw˚gh˝t, their agents, and their allies de-spise such.17Probably the most memorable day after September 11th for many muwahhid˝n was the day the Islamic State was an-nounced nine years ago in Iraq (Ramad˚n 1427). It was a state based upon tawh˝d and jih˚d with a Qurash˝ im˚m. It was a foundation for the future khil˚fah. Its leadership disbelieved in defeatist compromise and relied upon Allah alone, even if such entailed being fought by the entire camp of kufr and deviance.A few months later, the Iraqi Sahwah was launched. ˜e Americans provided corrupt tribes and partisan factions with the incentive and aid for the newly formed Sahwah to wage a treacherous war against the Islamic State. ˜e Is-lamic State then, in 1427-1428AH, began losing territory to these crusader-backed apostates. It was experiencing just some of the tests and tribulations that all truthful believers face, as in the had˝th, ﬁ˜e people who face the severest tribulations are the Prophets, then those most like them, then those most like them. A person is tested with trib-ulation to the extent of his religious practice. If his prac-tice is strong, the tribulation he faces is stronger. And if his practice is weak, the tribulation he faces is in accordance with his religious practiceﬂ [Sah˝h: Reported by at-Tirmidh˝ from Sa™d Ibn Ab˝ Waqq˚s].During the tumult of this Sahwah conspiracy, a point came in which it appeared to the weak-hearted that the Islamic State would be a legend of the past, reminding us of the Battle of al-Ahz˚b {when they came at you from above you and from below you, and when eyes turned upwards [in fear], and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah various assumptions. ˜ere the believers were tested and shaken severely. And remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said, ﬁAllah and His FROM THE PAGES OF HISTORY: B˜QIYAHMessenger did not promise us except delusionﬂ} [Al-Ahz˚b: 10-12]. ˜is was what occurred throughout the events of the Sahwah in Iraq. ˜e believers were shaken severely but remained ˛rm, whereas the hypocrites came out and began to criticize the creed and methodology of the Islamic State.And despite these great tribulations; a man spoke out with a truthful tongue and sincere heart; we consider him such and Allah is his judge. He was the recently appointed Am˝r of the Believers, Shaykh Ab˙ ‚Umar al-Husayn˝ al-Baghd˚d˝ (may Allah accept him). He spoke his words holding good assumptions about Allah, being certain of Allah™s promise, and having no doubts that Allah would ever forsake them. He said in his famous speech ﬁ˜e Harvest of the Years by the State of the Muwahhid˝n,ﬂ released six months after the declaration of the Islamic State in Iraq and during the dark waves of the Sahwah:ﬁ˜e Islamic State is b˚qiyah (remaining). It is b˚qiyah be-cause it was built from the corpses of the shuhad˚™ and it was watered with their blood, and by this the market of Jan-nah was convened. It is b˚qiyah because the success granted by Allah in this jih˚d is clearer than the sun in the middle of the sky. It is b˚qiyah because it was not soiled by har˚m income nor a distorted methodology. It is b˚qiyah by the truthfulness of the leaders who sacri˛ced their blood and the truthfulness of the soldiers who raised it with their fore-arms; we consider them such, and Allah is their judge. It is b˚qiyah because it united the muj˚hid˝n and is the refuge of the oppressed. It is b˚qiyah because Islam has begun to rise and climb, the dark cloud has begun to scatter, and kufr has begun to be defeated and exposed. It is b˚qiyah because it is the supplication of the oppressed, the tear of the bereaved, the cry of the prisoner, and the hope of the 1718orphan. It is b˚qiyah because kufr in all its religions and sects gathered against it and because every treacherous and cowardly person of desire and heresy began to slander and defame it; so we became certain of the truthfulness of the goal and correctness of the path. It is b˚qiyah because we are upon certainty that Allah will not break the hearts of the oppressed muwahhid˝n and He will not let the oppressive people rejoice over such a defeat. It is b˚qiyah because Allah  promised in His explicit revelation by saying, {Allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession to authority upon the Earth just as He granted it to those be-fore them and that He will surely establish for them therein their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security} [An-N˙r: 55]. {And Allah is predominant over His aˆair, but most of the people do not know} [Y˙suf: 21].ﬂHe said these words with certainty granted by Allah  alone. His words touched the depths of the hearts, remind-ing them of Allah™s promise to His believers and keeping them ˛rm for years to come. ˜e Islamic State would re-main, despite the crusaders, the taw˚gh˝t, the tribal and fac-tional sahw˚t, the R˚˛dah, the Peshmerga, and the palace scholars.After the Iraqi Sahwah, the Islamic State remained with army camps in the deserts of al-Anb˚r, security cells operat-ing in the cities of Iraq, and shar™˝ judges to refer to for those who sought them. ˜e hypocritical jih˚d claimants began bashing it by claiming it was the so-called mistakes of the Islamic State that brought about the Sahwah, when there was no root for the Sahwah save the dormant but lurking hypocrisy in the hearts of the corrupt criminals, partisan factions, and deviant heretics. And the historic word ﬁb˚qi-yahﬂ continued to echo in the hearts of the muj˚hid˝n.It was not but a few years later that the Islamic State made a great comeback on the scene of Iraq. At the same time, it had entered into Sh˚m and prepared the foundation for wil˚y˚t there. ˜e words ﬁ˜e Islamic State is b˚qiyahﬂ ˛lled the air and echoed before this and also thereafter in various addresses of the Islamic State leadership. ˜e Islam-ic State not only remained in Iraq, it had spread to the Ara-bian Peninsula, Sh˚m, North and West Africa, Khur˚s˚n, al-Qawq˚z, and elsewhere.˜is is the history behind the statement ﬁ˜e Islamic State is b˚qiyah.ﬂMay Allah keep the Islamic State remaining and expanding until the muwahhid muj˚hid˝n ˛ght the armies of the cru-saders near D˚biq.  19NOTHING19In the Name of Allah, the Lord of all things, who permitted marriage and prohibited fornication, created us from a sin-gle soul, created from that soul its mate, and dispersed from the two of them many men and women. May blessings and peace be upon the Prophet and Messenger who disciplined and taught his companions, and upon those who are guided by his Sunnah and follow him with excellence until the Day of Judgment. As for what follows:Indeed, when the Shar˝™ah of our Lord was eliminated, the laws and rulings of the kuˆ˚r gained power in the lands of the Muslims, Islam was shamefully abandoned, and faces turned towards promiscuous Europe, the voice of falsehood rose and with it the voices of those hostile towards the peo-ple of the religion, and the cancer of those who legislate besides Allah  ate away at the Ummah™s body. ˜ey pro-hibited what He permitted, and permitted what He prohib-ited, and one of the most manifest things that they ruined and defamed in defense of women and their rights Œ as they claimed Œ was polygyny. ˜ey utilized their podiums to that end, including the podiums of the kufr˝ parliaments and the secular TV channels, and placed on these podiums howling dogs, fools who do not perceive nor know their foolishness. ˜eir poisoned words crept into the hearts of women from the lands of the Muslims, to the point that we almost couldn™t ˛nd a single woman that is accepting of this issue, except for those whom Allah protected.Allah  said in His clear-cut revelation, {And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then mar-ry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. ˜at is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice]} [An-Nis˚™: 3]. ˜is is a verse as clear as the sun that does not require extensive explanation or interpretation. ˜erefore, O slaves of Allah, you may marry two, three, or four women, unless you fear that you will have shortcomings in your fairness towards them or will fail to ful˛ll their rights, in which case you su˘ce with one wife. Ibn Kath˝r  said, ﬁHis state-ment {two or three or four} [An-Nis˚™: 3] means marry any women you wish apart from the orphans. If one of you wishes he may marry two, and if he wishes, three, and if he wishes, four.ﬂIndeed, Islam was not the ˛rst to introduce polygyny. Rath-er, it was present in the shar˝™ah of those before us. Allah™s Messenger  said, ﬁSulaym˚n Ibn D˚w˙d  said, ‚I will surely have intercourse with a hundred women tonight, or ninety nine, and every one of them will give birth to a knight who will wage jih˚d for the cause of Allah–™ﬂ [Re-ported from Ab˙ Hurayrah by al-Bukh˚r˝].What™s strange is that the Jews and the Christians taunt the Muslims with respect to polygyny, yet if they were to look into their own books they would™ve known that it was something present in their religions, for it is stated in their books that Ya™q˙b  had two wives and two concubines, and that D˚w˙d  had a number of wives and concubines, as mentioned in 2 Samuel [5: 13] and 1 Samuel [25: 42 Œ TWO, THREE, OR FOUR1920religion, and His Messenger  found their way towards them through the doubts that these enemies propagate, doubts that eˆectively state, ﬁNo to polygyny. Polygyny is oppression towards women.ﬂ And Allah is su˘cient for us and the best disposer of aˆairs.And it saddens me to say that with some of them, the mat-ter may reach the point of pronouncing a statement of kufr Œ and Allah™s refuge is sought Œ or a statement that could imply kufr, and Allah™s help is sought. You ˛nd her say-ing, with the Shayt˚n having inˇated her with falsehood, ﬁAnything but polygyny, anything but this ruling. O Allah forgive me, but I can™t handle it, neither for myself nor for others.ﬂ One woman even said to me when I was talking to her, ﬁDo you want me to commit kufr and thereby aposta-tize? If I saw him with another woman it would be a ˛tnah for me with respect to my religious adherence, and I would leave my home and wander about in loss!ﬂ And another woman asked her friend, ﬁWhat would you prefer? ˜at Al-lah frees your husband after being imprisoned for years and he would then marry a second woman, or that he remain imprisoned and not do do?ﬂ So she answered her saying blatantly, ﬁI prefer that he remain imprisoned, for that is easier on me than for him to marry a second wife!ﬂ My Lord, have mercy on us! For a Muslim, muwahhid husband to remain imprisoned by the R˚˛dah or other kuˆ˚r and be subjected to the worst kinds of torture is easier on the jeal-ous woman than for him to come out of prison and practice a law from the laws of Allah?! ˜is is all in addition to other dangerous statements which the woman doesn™t really think much about, but which may cast her into the ˛re of Hell, and Allah™s refuge is sought.And how many women in the lands of the Muslims display their ﬁdiscontentﬂ towards polygyny! I sat with some such women and advised them, and I found that with many of them the tone of their speech bears witness that this ﬁdis-contentﬂ is in fact a hatred of the ruling itself, even if the cursed Ibl˝s has sugarcoated it for the woman and down-played it for her, saying, ﬁIt™s only that you don™t want it for your husband, so you can™t be blamed!ﬂ So here I warn her, and I remind her of the statement of Allah , {But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they make you judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then ˛nd within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in submission} [An-Nis˚™: 65]. So where is your submission and where is your obedience to the command of your Lord and and His wisdom? You were not named a ﬁMuslimahﬂ to to begin with except because you™ve submitted to Allah with tawh˝d and yielded to Him with obedience! And how many muh˚jir˚t there are who are seekers of knowledge and whom I would consider to be from the best 44]. ˜ey also stated that Sulaym˚n  had 700 wives and 300 concubines, as mentioned in 1 Kings [11: 3].˜ey also stated Rahba™˚m (Rehoboam) Ibn Sulaym˚n, who according to them succeeded his father in kingship, had 18 wives and 60 concubines. ˜us, the men of the previous nations used to take many wives, and doing so was permit-ted in the shar˝™ah of those before us. ˜en the Shar˝™ah of Islam came and de˛ned a speci˛c number of wives that no Muslim is allowed to exceed, that number being four. As for concubines, then there is no limit.S˚lim reported from his father that Ghayl˚n Ibn Salamah ath-˜aqaf˝ embraced Islam while married to ten wom-en. So the Prophet  said to him, ﬁChoose four of themﬂ [At-Tirmidh˝ reported it in ﬁ˜e Book of Marriageﬂ and titled the subsection, ﬁChapter: What Has Come Concern-ing a Man Who Embraces Islam While Having Ten Wives;ﬂ Ibn M˚jah also reported it in ﬁ˜e Book of Marriageﬂ and titled the subsection, ﬁChapter: A Man Embraces Islam While Having More than Four Wivesﬂ].Indeed, the legislation of polygyny contains many wisdoms. Amongst them is that women are greater in number than men, who face many dangers and hardships in their lives, such as war, hazardous work, and disasters. Likewise, young men tend to prefer virgins and abstain from marrying wid-ows and divorcees, so who then would look after this group of women?Furthermortility, but instead of divorcing her Islam has permitted the man to marry another woman while keeping his infertile wife honored and supported.Also from the wisdoms of polygyny is that the woman, by her nature, has her life interrupted by phases in which she is unable to ful˛ll the rights of her husband, as is the case with menstruation, childbirth, and postpartum bleeding. So during such phases he can ˛nd in his other wives what should prevent him from falling into forbidden or suspi-cious matters. But, by Allah, if there were no virtue in po-lygyny other than the fact that it™s a prophetic Sunnah from the best of mankind, we would have su˘ced with that as a proof with which we would deafen the ears of the stubborn opponents.How much does it eat at my soul to openly mention a re-ality that makes the heart of a muwahhid bleed, that reality being that the opposition to polygyny, whether directly or indirectly, has gone beyond the blind women and now sits in the hearts of some of the female seekers of knowledge and women who adhere to the bulk of the shar™˝ rulings. ˜is became so after the calls of the enemies of Allah, the 2021of women, except that as soon as you mention this issue they completely ˇip and almost promote the slogans of sec-ularism without even realizing it. And there is no ability nor might except with Allah. Rather, from amongst them is she who praises Allah that her husband was killed before taking multiple wives, and to Allah we belong and to Him we will return! To her likes I say: Why did you make hijrah? Wasn™t it to establish the Shar˝™ah of Allah in the land? And isn™t po-lygyny a part of this Shar˝™ah? Know then that the One who has honored the Muslim woman and has given her rights that protect her from the plots of the wicked is the very One who has permitted for the man to marry those that please him of women. And based on that, it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to argue concerning the Shar˝™ah of Allah, accepting what pleases her and rejecting what goes against her desires. Bishr al-H˚f˝  (died 227AH) said, ﬁAll calamities lie in following your de-sires, and all cures lie in opposing themﬂ [Sifat as-Safwah].And indeed, this religion is a whole that cannot be divided. Allah  said, {So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? ˜en what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do} [Al-Baqarah: 85]. So beware, my sister, of be-ing from amongst such people, and beware of letting your blind jealousy lead you to disliking this shar™˝ ruling, for it is feared that you would thereby fall into apostasy, as Allah  said, {˜at is because they disliked what Allah revealed, so He rendered worthless their deeds} [Muhammad: 9]. Im˚m Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah  stated when comment-ing on the ˚yah, {O you who have believed, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others, lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not} [Al-Hujur˚t: 2], ﬁSo if raising their voices above his voice was a cause for rendering their deeds void, then how much more so is advancing and raising their opinions, intellects, personal tastes, politics, and experience over that which he came with? Is this not more be˛tting of being a cause for rendering their deeds void?ﬂ [I™l˚m al-Muwaqqi™˝n].And every Muslimah should know that it is normal for her to be jealous and feel sad if her husband marries another woman, and we are not better than the Mother of the Be-lievers, the pure sidd˝qah, daughter of as-Sidd˝q, ‚™ishah, of whose jealousy much has been narrated. However, she nev-er opposed what Allah had permitted and did not prevent her husband Œ the Prophet Œ from marrying another ™ishah (may Allah be pleased with her and with her father) never stood in his way saying, ﬁIt™s either me or her. Divorce me and marry her.ﬂ Far be it from her to do so!˜e Shayt˚n Œ and it may be a human shayt˚n from amongst the women Œ will say to you, ﬁIf he loved you, he wouldn™t have married another woman while being married to you.ﬂ So say to him or her, ﬁOur Prophet  married seven wom-en after ‚™ishah while she was the most beloved person to him, and his love for her did not weaken or decrease, until our Lord allowed him to pass away in her room with his head between her chest and her neck. May my mother and father be sacri˛ced for him!ﬂHe will also say to you, ﬁYou never had any shortcomings in any of your dealings with him, so where does he get the right to marry another woman while being married to you?ﬂ So say to him, ﬁEven if I were from the most per-fect of women, and the best of them in character, beauty, knowledge, and manners, the Legislator has not exempted me from amongst other women, and has given the man the right to marry a second, a third, or a fourth woman!ﬂ˜e whisperer, whether human or jinn, will also say to you, ﬁYou can prevent him, make things di˘cult for him, make his life unpleasant, and incite the children against him.ﬂ So say to him, ﬁYes, I can, and indeed the schemes of wom-en are tremendous, as our Lord has described, but where would I be with respect to having fear of my Lord ? And where would I be with respect to Him making things di˘-cult for me in the Duny˚, and His questioning of me in the Hereafter, if I oppose what He has allowed and hate what He has permitted?!ﬂHe will also say to you, ﬁYou will not bear seeing your hus-band with another wife, and it™ll inevitably be a ˛tnah for you with respect to your religious adherence!ﬂ So say to him, ﬁIt will not be a ˛tnah for me, and Allah is my protector. Allah will not abandon me when I have submitted to His wisdom and yielded to His law!ﬂ ˜en with the statement of Allah , cut oˆ from them the channels through which they try to blow and inˇate you with falsehood: {It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should have any choice about their aˆair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error} [Al-Ahz˚b: 36].And my advice to you, my sister, O wife of a man who prac-tices polygyny: I know with certainty that there is no jih˚d more di˘cult for a slave than jih˚d against one™s inner self. Indeed, Ibnul-Qayyim  said, ﬁ˜e most obligatory jih˚d is to wage jih˚d against one™s inner self, against one™s desires, against the Shayt˚n, and against the Duny˚. So whoever wages jih˚d against these four things for the sake of Allah, Allah will guide him upon the paths to attain His pleasure, which lead him to His Paradiseﬂ [Al-Faw˚™id]. So if you wage jih˚d against this inner self that persistently incites you to do evil, place a barrier between you and the whispers of the retreater (Shayt˚n), restrain your jealousy with the 21TWO, THREE, OR FOUR22reins of the Shar˝™ah, and remain patient and forbearing and anticipate Allah™s rewards Œ for what is with Allah is better and more lasting Œ then you will be at ease, enjoy relief, and have a pleasant life.So pay no attention to the statements of unprincipled wom-en whose sources of reference are vile plays and soap operas. Rather, let your example be the women of the prophetic household . And every sister should know that when her husband wants to marry another woman, it™s not obligatory for him to consult her, nor to seek her permission, nor to try and appease her. If he does that, it is an act of generosity on his part and a means of preserving the companionship be-tween the two of them. So be content, my sister, submit to Allah with obedience, and yield to His law. And if a woman does this, then it is ˛tting for the Most Generous to increase her rewards in the Duny˚ and the Hereafter.Here, I also wish to address the men, both those who have multiple wives and those who intend to take multiple wives, and remind them of two matters. ˜e ˛rst is that the wom-an, as is known, was created from a curved rib, so if you, our brother, have made the decision to marry a second, then I remind you by Allah to be gentle with her and speak softly to her, and be extremely patient and tolerating when you inform her of your intent. Don™t be afraid of her initial reac-tion, be patient with her, and use in your advice the words of Allah  and the had˝th of His Prophet . And if she™s stubborn, then frighten her with the Almighty and remind her that this is a part of this Shar˝™ah, and that we are in a state whose system of rule is khil˚fah upon prophetic meth-odology insh˚™all˚h. If, however, she refuses and is arrogant then I say to you what Allah  said addressing the best of those who walked the earth: {O Prophet, why do you pro-hibit [yourself from] what Allah has made lawful for you, seeking the approval of your wives? And Allah is Forgiv-ing and Merciful} [At-Tahr˝m: 1]. Im˚m at-Tabar˝  says, ﬁ˜e people of knowledge diˆered over which lawful mat-ter Allah had permitted for His Messenger and His Messen-ger then prohibited himself from. Some of them said that it was M˚riyah, his Coptic slave-girl, whom he prohibited for himself with an oath that he would not come near her, thereby seeking to please his wife Hafsah Bint ‚Umar, be-cause she had become jealous of M˚riyah being alone with Allah™s Messenger  on her day and in her room. Others said that it was something he used to drink and which he liked. ˜e correct statement on this issue is to say that what the Prophet  prohibited for himself was something that Allah had made lawful for him, and it™s possible that it was his slave-girl, and it™s possible that it was a type of drink, and it™s possible that it was something other than that, but what-ever it was, he prohibited for himself something that was lawful for him so Allah admonished him for prohibiting something that He had made lawful for him and declared the dissolution of the oath which he had taken and that it was forbidden for him to make this prohibited for himself.ﬂ For this reason, don™t make it prohibited for yourself to help preserve the honor of a widow or become the guardian of an orphan because you seek to please your wife!As for the second issue, then I wish to remind the men, both those who have multiple wives and those who intend to take multiple wives, to fear Allah , and also remember that oppression will be darkness on the Day of Judgment, and that the crooked side of your body will not be recti˛ed by the wife whom you crookedly inclined to in the Duny˚, thereby oppressing another of your wives in the process and falling short in your duties towards her and mistreating her. ˜at day {a man will ˇee from his brother and his mother and his father and his wife and his children} [‚Abas: 34-36].Furthermore, the frontiers of the Islamic State Œ may Allah grant it victory Œ have increased in number and its front-lines have multiplied after all the paths of kufr and nif˚q allied together to wage war against it, and no war takes place except that there are people killed on both sides, as Allah said, {Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise. ˜ey ˛ght in the cause of Allah, so they kill and are killed} [At-Tawbah: 111].How many a shah˝d ascends from this Duny˚ Œ we consider him so, and Allah is his judge Œ and leaves behind a grieving wife and orphaned children. So who after Allah  is willing to take care of them? If one of the Sah˚bah were killed and he had a wife, the others would race one another to propose to her once she had completed her ‚iddah, each one wanting to help preserve her honor and become the guardian of an orphan, knowing that his reward is with the Master . And I used to always say to my Muslim sisters, ﬁAllah  says, {Never will you attain the good [reward] un-til you spend from that which you love. And whatever you spend Œ indeed, Allah is Knomr˚n: 92], and the husband is from amongst that which the wife loves, so why doesn™t she spend from him, seeking the face of her Lord, by being content with him marrying another wom-an?ﬂ Let every sister just put herself in the shoes of the wife of a shah˝d and sacri˛ce some of the sel˛shness that is a part of our nature!And our ˛nal call is: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all cre-ation. May Blessings and peace be upon our leader, Mu-hammad, and upon all his family and companions.2223HIKMAH23he dislikes, then he should be patient with him, for whoever parts from the  said, ﬁWhoever leaves obedience, parts from the  said, ﬁWhoever withdraws his hand from obedience 24fulness of his heart, then he must obey the ruler as The Prophet  said, ﬁThere will be tribulation and tribulawhile it is united, then strike him Œ whoever he may be Œ with In another narration, he  said, ﬁWhoever comes to you DecisivenessOr Division2425vicinity of the airbase, including the Abul-Wal˝d farms, Buy˙t ad-Dughaym, Dashmat Hamad, and the Zan˙biy˚ factory next to the entrance to the airbase. ˜is occurred after several days of continuous clashes during the course of which several istishh˚d˝ operations were carried out. ˜e soldiers of the Khil˚fah continue to besiege the airbase, an-ticipating its pending liberation, bi idhnill˚h.Wil˚yat al-Barakah - On Wednesday the 1st of Dhul-Hijjah, our brother Ab˙ ‚Amr al-Barakah succeeded in breaching PKK security checkpoints in the city of al-Barakah and at-tacked the murtadd˝n™s public relations headquarters locat-ed on the outskirts of the Mushayrifah neighborhood.

Just ˛ve days later, they struck again, tar-geting Kunio Hoshi, a citizen of Japan, one of the member nations of the crusader coalition. He was closely tracked and eliminated in the city of Rangpur using a ˛rearm. Just three weeks later, on the 10th of Muharram, the muj˚hid˝n detonated a number of IEDs on the D˚l˚n temple in the city of Dhaka as the R˚˛dah were conducting their shirk˝ rituals, killing and wounding nearly 100 of them.

Two istishh˚d˝ operations were then carried out by our brothers Ab˙ Ayman ash-Sh˚m˝ and Abul-Khans˚™ al-Hims˝ using a tank and a BMP rigged with explosives. ˜ey targeted two groups of Nusayr˝ soldiers inside the battalion base, and their attacks were fol-lowed by an assault in which the muj˚hid˝n succeeded in taking complete control of the base and capturing a large quantity of ghan˝mah. One month later, the muj˚hid˝n would score another major victory in their ongoing eˆorts to capture the Dayr az-Zawr airbase.

Meanwhile, another series of clashes that had begun on ˜ursday night continued for a number of hours and ended with the soldiers of the Khil˚fah taking control of extensive territory in other parts of the northern countryside. ˜e captured areas included the regions of al-Hurrah, Tall Sha™˝r, and Maz˚ri™ S˙siy˚n, as well as the cement factory and the small juvenile prison, and the villages of F˚f˝n, Tall Qarr˚h, Tall S˙s˝n, and Kafr Q˚ris. A dozen Sahwah ˛ghters were killed and a number of others imprisoned during the course of the operation, and the muj˚hid˝n captured light and heavy weapons and an assortment of ammo as ghan˝mah. Two Sahwah convoys then attempted to ˇee from the vil-lage of Tall Qarr˚h. ˜e soldiers of the Khil˚fah, however, were lying in wait for them and succeeded in ambushing and completely destroying both convoys and killing more than 40 murtadd˝n, with not a single Sahwah ˛ghter es-caping, walhamdulill˚h. Just two days later, on the 27th of Dhul-Hijjah, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah took control of two storehouses in the village of Tall S˙s˝n speci˛cally desig-nated for ˛ghting the Islamic State in the northern country-side. ˜e storehouses contained large quantities of all types of ammo, as well as light, medium, and heavy weapons, and some American weapons, in addition to shells, artillery cannons, wireless devices, night vision scopes, and other military equipment. ˜is string of victories demonstrated the muj˚hid˝n™s ability to make rapid and signi˛cant gains against the sahw˚t despite intense crusader aerial bombard-ment, and set the stage for further advances in the northern countryside.Wil˚yat Ham˚h - On Saturday the 10th of Muharram, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah launched a surprise assault on important Nusayr˝ checkpoints along the regime™s supply route to the city of Halab between the regions of Athriy˚ and Khan˚sir. ˜e assault began with two istishh˚d˝ op-erations targeting the Athriy˚ checkpoint and continued towards the road leading to Khan˚sir. During the course of the operation, which sought to cut oˆ the Nusayr˝ re-gime™s main arteries between Halab, Ham˚h, and Hims, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah succeeded in capturing 17 military checkpoints along the road, and approximately 70 Nusayr˝ soldiers were killed. ˜ey likewise succeeded in destroy-ing three tanks after targeting them with antitank missiles. With the Islamic State™s capture of this section of the road the Palace Hotel in ‚AdanPart of the Sahwah convoys ambushed as they attempted 27harram, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah carried out a major assault on Safaw˝ army and R˚˛d˝ Mobilization locations from several points in the regions located west of S˚mar-r˚™, including the regions of ash-Shar˝f ‚Abb˚s, al-Khuzaym˝ Street, al-‚Abb˚siyyah, and the dam.

During the course of the ongoing battles west of the city of S˚marr˚™, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah assaulted and captured 8 Safaw˝ army bar-racks in the region of al-L˚yin after those inside the barracks ˇed. ˜ey then continued their advance and completely captured the regions of ash-Shar˝f ‚Abb˚s, al-L˚yin, and S˚marr˚™ Silo. ˜e muj˚hid˝n also captured dozens of vehi-cles as ghan˝mah, in addition to light, medium, and heavy weapons, mortar rounds, and various equipment. ˜ey also took control of the road between the cities of Tikr˝t and S˚marr˚™, and captured three vehicles as ghan˝mah, two of which were mounted with heavy machine guns, in addition to a bulldozer and two Kornet missiles.Wil˚yat Dimashq - In an operation that began on the night of Saturday the 17th of Muharram, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah launched a major assault on the town of Mah˝n west of the city of al-Qaryatayn. Our brother Ab˙ N˚sir ash-Sh˚m˝ carried out an istishh˚d˝ operation with an ex-plosive vehicle, targeting and blowing up the A™l˚f check-point on the outskirts of the town. ˜e muj˚hid˝n then assaulted Nusayr˝ positions and succeeded in capturing the town, whose strategic importance lies in the fact that it™s located just 10km oˆ the highway between Hims and Di-mashq and near the Shu™ayr˚t military airbase. In addition, the muj˚hid˝n succeeded in capturing the weapons store-houses there.Wil˚yat Sayn˚™ Œ On Saturday, the 17th of Muharram, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah succeeded in downing a Russian air-liner above Wil˚yat Sayn˚™ with more than 220 Russian cru-saders onboard, all of whom were killed, walhamdulill˚h. ˜is was to show the Russians and whoever allies with them that they will have no safety in the lands and airspace of the Muslims, that their daily killing of dozens in Sh˚m through their airstrikes will only bring them calamities, and that just as they kill, they will be killed, by Allah™s permission.Lebanon Œ On ˜ursday, the 29th of Muharram, the sol-diers of the Khil˚fah in Lebanon parked a motorbike rigged with explosives on al-Husayniyyah Street in the region of and the checkpoints it contained, the Nusayr˝ regime™s sup-ply route to the city of Halab and its countryside was com-pletely cut oˆ. ˜e Nusayr˝ regime made a failed attempt to recapture some of the points it had lost, summoning a convoy of reinforcements. ˜e soldiers of the Khil˚fah con-fronted them and succeeded in completely destroying the convoy and killing its personnel. ˜ey also captured a num-ber of tanks and BMPs, two Shilkas, two 120mm artillery cannons, a 37mm artillery cannon, and nearly 10 Dushka and 14.5mm machine guns as ghan˝mah, in addition to a number of light weapons and various types of ammo. Bat-tles continued for several days as the muj˚hid˝n continued advancing, capturing 6 more checkpoints and two hills, in addition to the heavily forti˛ed Athriy˚ pumping station. ˜e Nusayr˝ regime made several attempts throughout the week to recapture the locations it had lost, summoning one convoy of reinforcements after another. ˜eir increased des-peration led them to rely on dozens of Russian airstrikes as well as Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces and R˚˛d˝ militias in an attempt to reverse the gains made by the mu-j˚hid˝n, demonstrating the extent to which the Islamic State has worn down the Nusayr˝ army, rendering it largely im-potent without the support of its R˚˛d˝ and Russian allies.Wil˚yat al-Hij˚z - On Monday the 12th of Muharram, our brother Ab˙ Ish˚q al-Hij˚z˝ carried out an istishh˚d˝ oper-ation with an explosive belt targeting a gathering of Ism˚™˝l˝ murtadd˝n in the Mashhad temple in the Dahdah neigh-borhood in the region of Najr˚n.

No one realizes this blessing more than one who has experienced the crusader lands of the West, then Sh˚m tormented by the Baathist and Nusayr˝ taw˚gh˝t, followed by Sh˚m plundered by the apostates of the Free Syrian Army and its nationalist allies. Yes, the revived Kh-il˚fah is a blessing that no matter how much one attempted and strived to thank Allah for, he would never be able to ful˛ll the gratitude due upon him. But one has an example in D˚w˙d (‚alayhis-sal˚m) who was reported to have said, ﬁMy Lord, how can I thank You for Your blessings while I am not able to thank you except by Your blessing?ﬂ So Al-lah revealed to him, ﬁO D˚w˙d, do you not know that the blessings you have are from Me?ﬂ He replied, ﬁOf course my Lord.ﬂ Allah said to him, ﬁI am pleased with such as thankfulness from youﬂ [Reported by Im˚m Ahmad in ﬁAz-Zuhdﬂ]. We also have an example in M˙s˚  who was re-ported to have said, ﬁMy Lord, how can I thank You while I am not able to compensate the smallest blessing from the blessings You™ve granted me with the total of all my deeds?ﬂ So Allah revealed to him, ﬁO M˙s˚, now you have thanked Meﬂ [Reported by Im˚m Ahmad in ﬁAz-Zuhdﬂ].Yes, Allah  blessed us by reviving the Khil˚fah for us through the soldiers of the Islamic State. He also blessed us by allowing us to thank Him for this great blessing. And none of this was achievable if not for Him alone.StrangenessStrangeness is a condition that the Muslim living in the West cannot escape as long as he remains amongst the cru-saders. He is a stranger amongst Christians and liberals. He is a stranger amongst fornicators and sodomites. He is a AND AS FOR THE BLESSING OF YOUR LORD, THEN MENTION IT2930stranger amongst drunkards and druggies. He is a strang-er in his faith and deeds, as his sincerity and submission is towards Allah  alone, whereas the kuˆ˚r of the West worship and obey clergy, legislatures, media, and both their animalistic and deviant desires. For them it is strange that one manifests sincere submission to His Lord in word and deed. It is strange that one works for the giving it priority to the Duny˚. It is strange that one does not pur-sue his animalistic desires like a beast and even experiment with perverted desires like a devil! ˜ey are as the accursed Sodomites who said about L˙t , {ﬁEvict them from your city! Indeed, they are men who keep themselves pureﬂ} [Al-A™r˚f: 82].˜is prevalence of deviance Œ although expected, as it was prophesized in the Sunnah Œ is against the ˛trah of a hu-man being, never mind the Muslim who has by his Lord™s grace held onto his ˛trah of sincerity, purity, and morality. And although the Mu™min stranger is blessed in the Sunnah of the Messenger , the Mu™min does not strive to make Islam strange. Rather he strives to revive and spread Islam and make j˚hiliyyah endangered and extinct.˜us, the Muslim in the West is in a constant struggle. His ˛trah is at war with the deviant drifts of the kuˆ˚r sur-rounding him. ˜e battle to preserve his ˛trah and faith knows no cease˛re. If he wants to preserve what mustard seed of faith he has been blessed with, he must exhaust him-self to the utmost so as to remain just a Muslim, never mind a Mu™min striving for jih˚d. If he abandons the struggle or brieˇy falters, he will quickly ˛nd himself an apostate.Another di˘culty present in the West is that in general no mas˚jid exist except those of dir˚r (evil harm) and de-viance run by the Ikhw˚n, the Su˛s, the Mad˚khilah, the Sur˙riyyah, the Tabl˝gh Jam˚™ah, the Deobandis, and the modernists. ˜ere are almost no mas˚jid in which one can seek shelter from heresy and belong to a community of strangers. If the proper da™wah exists, it is mostly against the deviant parties in control of the ﬁmas˚jid,ﬂ as they become the priority when there is no abode for the truth nor body representing it.In general, this is the case most Muslims have experienced while living in the West. He feels himself a stranger and is in constant search for a land in which he can practice his Islam more fully, especially if he hopes for jih˚d and is un-der the threat of crusader intelligence agencies persecuting him. He sleeps every night with a knife or pistol beside him, fearing an overnight or early morning raid on his home, for he regularly reminds himself and others with the obligation of jih˚d.˜is is how I had felt in the West and so I ˇed with my religion towards Sh˚m a few years before the ﬁSyrian Rev-olution.ﬂI immediately felt diˆerent amongst the people of Sh˚m. I no longer felt a stranger for merely adhering to some of the manifest rites of Islam that would create shockwaves in the West. But much was still missing. Having a longer beard drew suspicion from the murtadd security forces. Raising your hands before and after ruk˙™ also drew their suspi-cions, as it implied you were Salaf˝. Seeking knowledge also drew their suspicions. ˜e intention for jih˚d was a crime. Animosity towards the t˚gh˙t was also a crime. Takf˝r of the R˚˛dah, the Nusayriyyah, and the Baathists was a crime as well. It continued to feel strange in Sh˚m, although the degree and nature of the strangeness were less severe.˜ere, relatives and colleagues only spoke about the Duny˚. ˜eir tongues were busied with the prices of basic goods and the décor of their homes. Otherwise, they backbit each other. ‚Aq˝dah and jih˚d were strange to many if not most people. ˜ey had been corrupted by the ﬁreligionﬂ propagat-ed by regime government ﬁscholarsﬂ and ﬁreligiousﬂ satellite media. I had to argue with some who thought that Jamal Abdil Nasir, Bashar al-Asad, the Nasserites, the Baathists, and other Arab taw˚gh˝t and murtadd˝n were ﬁMuslimsﬂ! I had to argue with others who thought that the R˚˛dah, Hasan Nasrull˚t, and Hizb al-L˚t were ﬁMuslimsﬂ and even ﬁmuj˚hid˝nﬂ! Worse, I had to argue with those who thought that the Nusayriyyah were ﬁMuslimsﬂ! I even had to argue with some who thought that seeking intercession from the dead or cursing the religion was completely ﬁnormalﬂ!˜is was shocking, considering that I had always held good assumptions about the people living in the Muslims™ lands and assumed that the murtadd taw˚gh˝t had not succeeded in corrupting the religion of people except super˛cially. ˜e atmosphere there was also a bit dangerous, as the Duny˚ being the priority of most people aˆected one™s struggle for jih˚d. It was another strangeness one had to deal with.A few years later, I observed the ﬁArab Springﬂ jumping from Tunisia to Egypt to Libya to Yemen. I hoped that the chaos brought about by the ﬁArab Springﬂ would come to Sh˚m, as it would facilitate the revival of jih˚d there. At the same time, I thought that because of how much the people of Sh˚m dreaded massacres like those committed by the re-gime during the early ﬁ1980sﬂ in Halab, Ham˚h, Tadmur, Jisr ash-Shugh˙r, and elsewhere, and because of how much their religion was damaged by ˛fty years of Baathist rule, in addition to their attachment to the Duny˚, they would never move. I was wrong, and some youth made the move, those who had only heard of these massacres in stories their parents narrated to frighten them into apathy. I met some of these youth, cooperated with a religious selection of them, and gained ˛rsthand insight into the nature of the protests.Sadly, a large collection of the protestors was not driven by Islam. Many secularists, who called for a new t˚gh˙t based in democracy, would repeat ﬁAll˚hu akbarﬂ due to the back-31ground and culture they were raised in, not because they believed Allah was greater and accordingly alone had the right to legislate. Many of them would attend taraw˝h and Friday prayers only to join the protests, otherwise they had nothing to do with prayer and mas˚jid. I myself had to ar-gue with a secularist who had come to attend the funeral of a man upon the manhaj of jih˚d killed in prison by the Nusayr˝ regime. I told the secularist shortly before the fu-neral, ﬁI advise you to repent from secularism before the fu-neral. Otherwise, if you die, you will be in Hell˛re.ﬂ Rather than taking my advice, he shouted and argued that Syrian nationalism and separation of religion and state were not secularism! ˜is was because the ignoramus thought that secularism was synonymous with atheism.At a later incident, I ended up in prison for some time after being caught by the murtadd Shab˝hah. I was in a chamber with sixty prisoners all of whom were also arrested for rea-sons related to the protests. Sadly, less than ten of the sixty would pray the ˛ve daily prayers! And cursing the religion was not uncommon amongst these prisoners. Alhamdu-lill˚h, my imprisonment was short, lasting a week.Amongst the protestors, there were also those thoughtless ﬁIslamistsﬂ who would admit that Burh˚n Ghaly˙n and the Syrian National Council were kuˆ˚r, but would claim it was not the time to declare takf˝r of them! (˜ere were also the online jih˚d claimants that said it was not the time for jih˚d because it would damage the image of the ﬁrevolu-tion.ﬂ) Again, it was a new strangeness one had to deal with.As the protests became more militant, the slogans raised by the various nationalists and secularists also became more militant. ˜e presence of the Islamic State in the arena Œ ˛rst under the name of ﬁJabhat an-Nusrah,ﬂ then under the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and Sh˚m (before the re-vival of the Khil˚fah) Œ also forced the political and religious spectrum in Sh˚m to shift. ˜e secularists and nationalists were now in a propaganda race with the muj˚hid˝n. ˜e Free Syrian Army, the t˚gh˙t-backed factions, and the cru-sader-backed proxies all had to appeal to the inclinations of the common folk in Sh˚m, who in general dislike secular-ism even if some are ignorant of what Islamic rule should be. It was also harder to convince a Muslim or even an igno-rant claimant of Islam to ˛ght for a cause when the choice was between getting killed for a little money or attaining a place near Allah in Jannah. And so many of the secularists and nationalists became more ﬁIslamicﬂ (only super˛cially), and some of them even joined and in˛ltrated some of the more ﬁIslamicﬂ factions.Before having the opportunity to join the Islamic State, which had entered Sh˚m under the name of ﬁJabhat an-Nusrah,ﬂ I fought in some battles alongside members of some local factions who then claimed to ˛ght for the Shar˝™ah; that was before foreign aid caused their hypocrisy to surface. Deeply rooted nationalism and regional pride were matters they could not rid themselves of. ˜ose from the countryside always boasted with pride that they were from the countryside and not from the city. ˜ose from cer-tain villages would always boast that they were from one vil-lage and not another. Smoking in Ramad˚n was customary amongst these ˛ghters. Cursing the religion at moments of anger was not uncommon. Robbing the common folk and stealing war booty was widespread. I realized that they were a Sahwah waiting for a sponsor to activate them. Alham-dulill˚h, I was able to join the Islamic State, called ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ then. ˜ereby, the strangeness again reduced in its severity.But it did not cease to exist. In addition to the apostates of the Free Syrian Army, we were surrounded by hypocritical factions who were lurking in wait to announce their wal˚™ to democracy and the taw˚gh˝t. Any muh˚jir who was wanted by the crusaders or the taw˚gh˝t was cautious of these hypo-crites, for there was nothing preventing them from arresting him and handing him over to the kuˆ˚r. ˜ese hypocritical factions always caused problems for the muh˚jir˝n, as if they were ordered to do so by the crusaders and the taw˚gh˝t. It was another form of strangeness one had to deal with.˜e Islamic State leadership was wise and ordered that its operations under the name of ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ be gen-erally independent of the deviant factions. But many of the Syrian leaders in ﬁJabhat an-Nusrahﬂ had drawn closer to the deviant factions, due to them having relatives or for-mer colleagues in these factions. ˜ey were thus sensitive to the concepts of wal˚™ and bar˚™ and sam™ (listening) and t˚™ah (obeying). ˜ey detested legit criticism of these fac-tions. ˜ey complained of the order from the Islamic State leadership to avoid Œ as much as was possible Œ cooperation with the more deviant factions. ˜ey criticized the order to disassociate from those factions. ˜ey would blame all problems between the ﬁJabhahﬂ and the other factions on the presence of muh˚jir˝n. Slowly, they tried to limit the reception of muh˚jir˝n. In Halab, this order was given by AND AS FOR THE BLESSING OF YOUR LORD, THEN MENTION IT32Ab˙ Ahmad Zakk˙r Œ former leader of Halab appointed by Jawl˚n˝. ˜at was two months or so before the o˘cial announcement of the Islamic State of Iraq and Sh˚m.˜e blessed announcement was made and split Sh˚m into two distinct camps with a fading grayzone. ˜is polariza-tion also aided in shifting the religious and political spec-trum even more. ˜e nationalist and criminal factions had to feign an ﬁIslamicﬂ tone, one whose hypocrisy would resonate. Suddenly various factions changed their banners and names to appear more ﬁIslamic.ﬂ ˜ey would mix their nationalist messages with occasional words that could be interpreted in a manner that a naïve youth would consid-er ﬁIslamic.ﬂ ˜is super˛cial ﬁIslamizationﬂ of the factions carried on until three months before the Sahwah, when a process of de-ﬁIslamizationﬂ began.Even the jih˚d claimants allied to the nationalist and secu-larist factions changed their tone. Suddenly they were ad-mitting the presence of muh˚jir˝n and murmuring takf˝r of the taw˚gh˝t, after months of claiming such issues would ﬁdamageﬂ the jih˚d.˜en came the events of the Sahwah, but unlike the Iraqi Sahwah in ﬁ2006/2007ﬂ that forced the Islamic State out of the cities into the deserts of Iraq, the Sahwah brought the Islamic State consolidation it had not experienced as extensively before in Sh˚m. Suddenly vast regions of al-Khayr, ar-Raqqah, Hims, eastern Halab, and al-Barakah were exclusively under the rule of the Islamic State with-out any hypocritical or apostate factions disputing its rule therein. ˜e expansion of the Islamic State after the Sah-wah conspiracy was followed by further consolidation in Iraq and the revival of the Khil˚fah. Suddenly the muh˚jir could travel from al-B˚b and Manbij in Sh˚m to Mosul and al-Fall˙jah in Iraq, while not fearing anything but a ˇat tire.˜e Khil˚fah was revived, and muh˚jir˝n were now pour-ing into Sh˚m from all corners of the Earth at a rate much greater than ever before. One no longer felt the strangeness he would experience in the lands of the crusaders nor that in the lands of the taw˚gh˝t nor that in the territories of the nationalist factions. He now had his own land, where his creed was upheld and his methodology was enforced, the creed and methodology of Islam, the Sunnah, the Jam˚™ah. No ikhw˚nism, no irj˚™, no hizbiyyah. After almost twenty years of living under the persecution of the crusaders and the apostates, one could ˛nally live an Islamic life with safety and security. He was able to prac-tice his faith in jih˚d without worry of the k˚˛r intelligence agencies suddenly raiding his home. He could pronounce takf˝r of the taw˚gh˝t and the murtadd˝n without fear of imprisonment. He could raise his children away from the school systems of the kuˆ˚r without fear of the social ser-vices kidnapping his children.And he was no longer a stranger inside his own community. He was surrounded by muwahhid muj˚hid˝n. He would easily ˛nd several muj˚hid˝n walking besides himself on any major street inside the cities of the Islamic State. If he went to the mas˚jid or even the shops, he would ˛nd muj˚hir˝n and ans˚r. Many of the common folk were also eagerly rushing to Shar˝™ah courses to learn and practice their reli-gion. ˜e conversation of many of them became, ﬁIs such and such bid™ah? Is such and such Sunnah?ﬂ after years of conversation about the Duny˚ alone.˜e severe strangeness had been lifted. ˜e only strangeness to confront was that of the crusader alliance, the Sahwah alliance, and the Safaw˝ alliance. But this strangeness was welcome, as it was the key to shah˚dah and Jannah.O Allah, what comes to us of good is from You alone; You have no partner; To You is due all praise and thanks. O Al-lah, preserve the great blessing of the Khil˚fah for us until Prs˚  descends to lead us. O Allah, make us from Your thankful slaves.Finally, Allah™s Messenger  said, ﬁWhoever does not thank the people has not thanked Allahﬂ [Reported by Im˚m Ah-mad and at-Tirmidh˝ from Ab˙ Hurayrah]. And this Khil˚-fah would not be safe if not for those Allah chose to guard its frontlines. May Allah reward the mur˚bit˝n, muq˚til˝n, and shuhad˚™ with great good in both the D-irah.And all praise is due to Allah by whose blessing all good matters are completed.spread to all the arenas of 33Shortly before making hijrah to Sh˚m a few years ago from the crusader nation in which I™d been raised, my mother men-tioned to me that she had recently spoken to a family friend from back home who asked her about our condition and the condition of other families from the same country who were living in the West. She told me that she claimed we were all doing well Œ and in the Duny˚ sense we were in fact doing fairly well Œ when in reality, as my mother said, ﬁEvery family that comes here suˆers one calamity or another with respect to their children.ﬂ What she was referring to, as she went on to clarify, were the countless Muslim youth in the West who get themselves tangled into drugs, alcohol, gangs, promiscuity, and other vices and social illnesses over which any decent Mus-lim family would weep for its children.And yet as terrible as these vices may be, the fact remains that many still downplay the severity of kufr in comparison with other sins. ˜is is not to water down the issue of com-mitting sins but for the sake of perspective I need to make it clear that this is addressed to Muslims who are risking their entire Hereafter by continuing to live under the authority of the crusaders waging war against Islam or in lands ruled by apostate taw˚gh˝t governing by manmade laws. In such a scenario, the blessed ones are often those who are able to survive with their ˝m˚n intact and a mountain of sins to answer for on the Day of Judgment. But even in the case of those who eventually make the decision to leave such lands and perform hijrah to d˚rul-Isl˚m after Allah guides them and opens their eyes to the dangerous situ-ation they are in, it™s often too late for their family. For many, the decision to save themselves comes after they™ve already lost their children, some to drugs and promiscu-ity, and others to kufr, shirk, and even atheism. And it all begins in the schools.Many of those who send their children to the schools of the kuˆ˚r are ﬁuneducatedﬂ1 and thereby unable to teach their children themselves, so they rely on others to teach them. Many others are in ˛nancial need, so they don™t have the money to hire a Muslim tutor that can teach their children without incorporating un-Islamic 1 ˜is is a term used to refer exclusively to secular ﬁeducation.ﬂ Many people have been duped into believing that a secular ﬁeducationﬂ is a ﬁnecessity,ﬂ so much so that they consider it a child™s essential ﬁrightﬂ to waste dozens of years in school to obtain a piece of paper that may ultimately have nothing to do with the profession he later works in! In addition to this, one could memorize the Qur™˚n and study the Sunnah with a scholar, but if he Œ despite all that Œ hadn™t completed his secular ﬁeducation,ﬂ he would be labeled ﬁuneducatedﬂ!33O YOU WHO HAVE BELIEVED, PROTECT YOURSELVES AND YOUR FAMILIES FROM FIRESyrian elementary school children being indoctrinated into a system of kufr34concepts into their lessons and are thus ﬁforcedﬂ to send their children to the schools of kufr, or so they claim. In the case of those who migrated to the West, most are unable to speak the language of the land, so they™re left at a severe dis-advantage when it comes to monitoring what their children are being taught in such schools. And from there, things go downhill.Children attending the schools of the kuˆ˚r are ˛rst intro-duced to the kufr˝ concept of nationalism, whereby they are required to stand for the national anthem, and in places such as America, pledge allegiance to some national symbol such as the ˇag, or recite nationalistic slogans, or pledge allegiance to a t˚gh˙t king or president, as is the case with the lands ruled by murtadd nationalist taw˚gh˝t. ˜e point is to indoctrinate them into the system as early as possible by beating into their heads that their loyalty, ˛rst and fore-most, is to the nation or to their race, not to the people of Islam, not to their religion, not even to Allah! ˜is runs contrary to wal˚™ and bar˚™, a fundamental cornerstone of Islam. {Your ally is none but Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed Œ those who establish prayer and give zak˚h, and they bow [in worship]. And whoever is an ally of Allah and His Messenger and those who have be-lieved Œ indeed, the party of Allah Œ they will be the pre-dominant} [Al-M˚™idah: 55-56].After initiating the destruction of their wal˚™ and bar˚™, the schools of kufr then introduce children to their open-ended concept of ﬁtoleranceﬂ beginning at a young age. ˜ey teach them to tolerate and respect other religions, even though Allah says, {And whoever desires other than Islam as reli-gion Œ never will it be accepted frmr˚n: 85] and {O you who have believed, indeed the mushrik˝n are unclean} [At-Tawbah: 28]. ˜ey teach them to tolerate and respect sodomites, even though Allah says, {And L˙t said to his people, ﬁDo you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing peopleﬂ} [Al-A™r˚f: 80-81].Apart from teaching them to accept all manner of religious deviance and social perversion, the schools of the kuˆ˚r en-courage children to take part in the various festivals of kufr and shirk, including Christmas, Halloween, and Easter, amongst others. ˜ey have them dress up, paint their faces, sing songs, attend parties, exchange gifts, and take part in school plays held for these various occasions.In addition to integrating the students into a culture re-plete with kufr and shirk and overtly teaching them nu-merous concepts that nullify one™s Islam, the kuˆ˚r seek to further corrupt them by incorporating anti-˛trah concepts into the curriculum that may lead them to question or even abandon their religion. ˜is is the case with those who use certain ﬁscienti˛c principlesﬂ such as the so-called ﬁscientif-ic methodﬂ as a backdoor for questioning the existence of Allah, even though Allah granted mankind the faculties of perception to observe and reˇect on the creation as a means of increasing their awe and reverence of Him, not for the purpose of leading them to kufr and atheism. {Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alterna-tion of the night and the day are signs for those of under-mr˚n: 190].˜is is just a brief illustration of the poison awaiting the youth and children of the Ummah who are sent to the schools of the kuˆ˚r, whether in the lands of the crusaders or in the lands of the apostate taw˚gh˝t. Having grasped the danger that Muslim children all over the world are exposed to, one can only ask how their parents could so willingly throw them into the ˛re of a kufr˝ education system!brainwashing at work35O YOU WHO HAVE BELIEVED, PROTECT YOURSELVES AND YOUR FAMILIES FROM FIREIndeed, raising one™s children upon Islam and teaching them to know and recognize the truth and be able to distinguish it from falsehood is a trust from Allah and a heavy burden placed upon the shoulders of every Muslim parent. And in that regard, He has provided us with an excellent example to follow in terms of prioritizing what to teach our children.{And [mention] when Luqm˚n said to his son while he was instructing him, ﬁO my son, do not associate anything with Allah. Indeed, shirk is great injusticeﬂ} [Luqm˚n: 13].It was reported that ‚Al˝ Ibn al-Husayn Ibn ‚Al˝ Ibn Ab˝ T˚lib  (died 94AH) when teaching his child, would tell him, ﬁSay, ‚I believe in Allah, and I disbelieve in t˚gh˙t™ﬂ [Reported by Ibn Ab˝ Shaybah in his musannaf under the chapter titled ﬁWhat It Is Preferred for a Child to Be Taught When He First Begins Learningﬂ].How is it then that one whom Allah has graced with the blessing of children could develop the audacity to neglect and belittle this trust that he™s been burdened with by send-ing them to be ﬁeducatedﬂ by the enemies of Allah?! And if some wish to argue that they have no choice because their children will be taken away by the k˚˛r authorities if they refuse to send them to school, I say to them, you are the ones who willingly choose to live like sheep in a land of wolves, so don™t blame the wolf for coming to snatch his prey! What led you to herd your family to the lands of the crusaders in the ˛rst place, and what keeps you and those residing in the lands of the apostate taw˚gh˝t so ˛rmly ˛xed in place, refusing to perform hijrah to the Islamic State? Is it a sincere desire to call the kuˆ˚r and murtadd˝n to Islam Œ all aspects of Islam, including those not tolerated by the enemies of Allah? Or is it perhaps a ˛rm intention to ˛ght them in their own lands? Or is it simply your deluded hope of attaining the Duny˚ or your reluctance to sacri˛ce it for the purpose of hijrah? If the answer is the latter Œ and those who are honest will admit that it is Œ then don™t expect your Lord to bless your endeavor to reside peacefully in the lands of kufr for the sake of pursuing the luxuries of this world, all the while neglecting your clear-cut duties towards your Lord and His religion. Rather, you should fear that He will punish you in this Duny˚ Œ through your children, amongst other means Œ before punishing you in the Hereafter if you refuse to sincerely repent before it™s too late.In my mother™s case, she would frequently state that her di-lemma was a punishment from Allah, and would show un-derstanding when I would express my disgust towards the idea of raising a family amongst the kuˆ˚r or sending my children to the schools of kufr. In one of our conversations on the topic, she reˇected over the condition of one of my siblings and lamented that she would have been better oˆ living as a beggar than to have migrated for the sake of the Duny˚ and risk losing her children in the process.For others who truly care for their sons and daughters and have not yet lost them, but have made the same mistake of sending them to be ﬁeducatedﬂ by wolves out of some misplaced hope to see them succeed, I oˆer you the most sincere advice that I can give you on this topic before it™s too late:{O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones} [At-Tahr˝m: 6].May Allah protect the Muslims and their children and youth from being corrupted at the hands of the kuˆ˚r and mun˚˛q˝n.Our children are a trust from Allah3637THE REVIVAL OF JIH˜D IN BENGAL3738˜e History of Jih˚d in BengalAs the Afghan jih˚d against the communists ended in the late ﬁeighties,ﬂ many of its veterans from various parts of the world Œ including Bengal1 Œ returned to their home-lands with the idea of opening jih˚d fronts there based on their newly gained experiences. However, as many of the returnees to Bengal from Khur˚s˚n had mistakes in their creeds and methodologies, including mistakes related to tawh˝d and wal˚™ and bar˚™, the founding of a proper jih˚d organization in Bengal based on the Qur™˚n and Sunnah and the understanding of the Salaf was delayed for years until the late ﬁninetiesﬂ when Allah blessed the martyred muj˚hid scholar Shaykh ‚Abdur-Rahm˚n  with success in gathering a handful of muwahhid˝n from diˆerent parts of the land to form an organization named ﬁJam˚™atul Mu-j˚hid˝nﬂ whose sole aim was establishing the law of Allah upon the earth. ˜us, a new light of hope was born amidst the Muslims of Bengal, a land that for hundreds of years has been drowned in shirk and bid™ah due to the eˆects of both European colonization and Hindu cultural invasion.Relying upon Allah alone, Shaykh ‚Abdur-Rahm˚n  and a few other muj˚hid scholars with him strived their utmost to gather the Muslims of Bengal upon a single platform based on the Qur™˚n, the Sunnah, and the understanding of the Salaf. ˜e newly formed group provided proper mil-itary training for the muj˚hid˝n and performed operations against the murtadd soldiers and judges of the t˚gh˙t gov-ernment and courts that ruled by manmade laws. With these blessed operations, Jam˚™atul Muj˚hid˝n tried its best to awaken the Muslim masses of Bengal to the impor-tance of ruling by Shar˝™ah and the fundamentals of wal˚™ and bar˚™. By Allah™s grace, the call of jih˚d reached various mad˚ris (Islamic schools) in Bengal and people started join-ing the jam˚™ah in great numbers. ˜us, the forces of the 1 Editor™s Note: Bengal is what the region was referred to before the foun-ding of ﬁBangladeshﬂ by nationalists in ﬁ1971.ﬂt˚gh˙t along with the deviant palace scholars were shaken and so the murtadd government imprisoned and executed the noble Shaykh ‚Abdur-Rahm˚n along with a few other truthful scholars and muj˚hid commanders in ﬁ2007.ﬂ May Allah accept them as martyrs and grant them the highest positions in Jannah.˜e former government, which consisted mainly of a coa-lition of murtadd˝n from both the ﬁBangladesh Nationalist Partyﬂ (BNP) and ﬁJamaat-e-Islami Bangladeshﬂ (essentially the Indian subcontinent version of the so-called ﬁMuslim Brotherhoodﬂ), foolishly thought that the call of tawh˝d, jih˚d, and khil˚fah would be crushed by the martyrdom of a few righteous scholars. ˜e taw˚gh˝t, the palace scholars, and those with diseased hearts forgot the promise of Allah , who said, {˜ey want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light even if the kuˆ˚r despise such} [As-Saˆ: 8]. ˜ey had forgotten that the tree of this Ummah is not watered except by the blood of its martyrs.˜ese murtadd˝n also ignored Allah™s warning mentioned in the quds˝ hadith, ﬁWhoever shows enmity towards a wal˝y of Mine, then I have declared war against himﬂ [Re-ported by al-Bukh˚r˝ from Ab˙ Hurayrah]. ˜us, they felt secure from the punishment of Allah, ignoring His decla-ration of war against them. Within only a few years, many high-ranking o˘cials and commanders of the t˚gh˙t forces Œ including some involved in the execution of the muj˚hid scholars Œ were killed in a mutiny within the ranks of the murtadd ﬁBangladesh Border Guard.ﬂ In recent days, both the nationalist murtadd˝n of the BNP and the parliamen-tary murtadd˝n of the ﬁJamaat-e-Islamiﬂ Œ who both called for, rejoiced at, and actively partook in the ﬁlegalﬂ process that led to the execution of the muj˚hid scholars Œ these same murtadd˝n were humiliated, dragged into prison, and given life-sentences and death penalties by the very same t˚gh˙t courts. Some of them have already been executed by Motiur Rahman Nizami - The murtadd head of the ﬁJamaat-39the t˚gh˙t government of the ﬁAwami League.ﬂ It was an ending similar to what befell the Iraqi sahw˚t at the hands of their former R˚˛d˝ allies. ˜us, Allah made an exam-ple out of the various parties of kufr that had cooperated against the muwahhid˝n. It was a lesson for others not to pursue a path leading to punishment in both the Duny˚ With the martyrdom of the muj˚hid leadership, the re-solve of the caravan was tested heavily and the ranks were cleansed of a large number of hypocrites who had initially joined the group for potential worldly gains. ˜us, only a few muwahhid˝n remained patient upon the di˘cult path of jih˚d and sacri˛ce while always maintaining certainty in Allah™s promise and always expecting good from Allah. ˜ey neither gave up jih˚d like the weak-hearted nor did they deviate from the proper methodology of the Qur™˚n and Sunnah by going after ﬁpopular supportﬂ as many jih˚d claimants infected with the love of Duny˚ and irj˚™ sadly had done. ˜e sincere muj˚hid˝n knew all along that it was neither the drones of the crusaders nor their modern high-tech weaponry that could harm them, but it was the gradual and discreet decline of wal˚™ and bar˚™ within the hearts that could deal the greatest injury to the cause of jih˚d.And just as occurred in the ﬁArab Spring,ﬂ this gradual decline of wal˚™ and bar˚™ reached its lowest peak during the mass protests in Dhaka against the atheist bloggers in ﬁ2013,ﬂ as the jih˚d claimants started to openly call for an alliance with the grave-worshippers who falsely claim to be ﬁlovers of the Prophetﬂ , the ﬁJamaat-e-Islamiﬂ who openly call for and support the religion of democracy, and the Deobandis who adopt the creed of the Jahmiyyah. ˜is ﬁallianceﬂ was called for in order to confront the ﬁcommon enemyﬂ of atheists and leftists who would curse Islam and Allah™s Messenger . ˜e jih˚d claimants alleged that caus-ing division within the ﬁUmmahﬂ over ﬁminorﬂ issues would divide and weaken the ﬁMuslimsﬂ in front of the atheists. Similarly, they claimed that the muj˚hid˝n should perform prayer according to the Hanaf˝ madhhab even if doing so entailed abandoning mutaw˚tir sunan. ˜ey justi˛ed this with a principle they had innovated, that the madhhab of the muj˚hid˝n was to perform prayer according to the cus-tom of the local people, as if the madhhab of the muj˚hid should be diˆerent from that of the Salaf!22 Editor™s Note: Sadly, this odd opinion was propagated in an unneces-sarily long 1600-page book titled ﬁDa™wat al-Muq˚wamah al-Isl˚miyyah al-‚ﬂ (ﬁ˜e Global Islamic Resistance Callﬂ). In the book, Ab˙ Mus™ab as-S˙r˝ advised jih˚d groups to not exert eˆort in warning against Qub˙riyyah, Ash™ariyyah, bid™ah, and taql˝d, claiming that this da™wah was being su˘ciently ful˛lled by other parties! According to him, a jih˚d group Œ for the sake of ﬁpopular supportﬂ Œ should instead let others receive the backlash for such da™wah! He also criticized the truthful mu-j˚hid˝n for making takf˝r of parliamentary ﬁIslamistsﬂ and the R˚˛dah, claiming that this was not the methodology of the ﬁmajority of jihadistsﬂ! He also suggested the ﬁmuj˚hid˝nﬂ should soften up towards the Arab nationalists for the sake of the war against the common ﬁforeignﬂ enemy! He also advised that a muj˚hid follow the local maddhab in his visible ˜ese jih˚d claimants demanded that the various jih˚d groups in Bengal give preference to maintaining ﬁpopular supportﬂ and pleasing deviant ﬁscholarsﬂ over the Qur™˚n and the Sunnah, otherwise the ﬁjih˚d movementﬂ would get ﬁcrushedﬂ by the martyrdom of leadership having no ﬁpopular supportﬂ as they claimed had happened in the past with Jam˚™atul Muj˚hid˝n. ˜ey focused on the ma-terialistic means over the divine support from Allah  and rushed to compromise with murtadd˝n and heretics instead of relying upon Allah  alone and remaining ˛rm upon the methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jam˚™ah. ˜ey la-beled as a ﬁKh˚rij˝ﬂ any Muslim who pronounced takf˝r upon those who fell into an explicit nulli˛er of Islam such as worshipping graves, joining parliament, and allying with the kuˆ˚r against the Muslims. ˜us, a new ˛tnah was launched against the confused, young muj˚hid˝n with im-pressionable minds. Sadly, many of them became aˆected by this rotten call for a ﬁpopulist jih˚d.ﬂ ˜e various ﬁjih˚d˝ﬂ groups in Bengal then became fragmented through disputes over issues of creed, methodology, leadership, strategy, and tactics.˜e Declaration of Khil˚fah˜en, by Allah™s grace, the Khil˚fah was revived from the blessed land of Sh˚m on 1 Ramad˚n 1436. ˜e rise of the Khil˚fah and its eˆective media campaign brought the light of hope to the hearts of young muj˚hid˝n in Bengal, just as it did in every other part of the globe. Just as the strong military campaign of the soldiers of the Khil˚fah was crush-ing the forces of kufr on the physical battle˛eld, the strong media campaign launched by the media soldiers of the Khil˚fah on the ideological battle˛eld continued to crush and destroy every specious argument invented by the jih˚d claimants and those infected with the diseases of irj˚™ and hizbiyyah. And so truth started to shed its light very quickly and the muwahhid˝n of Bengal rushed to pledge allegiance to the Khal˝fah.˜e muj˚hid˝n of Bengal realized that there was no room for blind partisanship towards any organization once the Khil˚fah had been declared and that there was no longer legitimacy for any independent jih˚d organization, whether ﬁJam˚™atul Muj˚hid˝n,ﬂ ﬁAl-Q˚™idah,ﬂ or any other group. ˜us, the sincere men from the various jih˚d groups rushed performance of acts of worship, even if doing so contradicted the cle-ar-cut Sunnah! It is important to note that contrary to Western media claims, this book never de˛ned the methodology of the muj˚hid˝n. ˜e top Islamic State leadership Œ including Shaykh Ab˙ Mus™ab az-Zarq˚w˝  Œ did not recommend as-S˙r˝™s book. As for the concise but bene˛cial 100-page book titled ﬁId˚rat at-Tawahhushﬂ (ﬁ˜e Management of Sava-geryﬂ) by an unknown author who only went by the penname ﬁAb˙ Bakr N˚j˝,ﬂ then when Shaykh az-Zarq˚w˝ read this book he commented, ﬁIt is as if the author knows what I™m planning.ﬂ Note: Although N˚j˝™s book describes very precisely the overall strategy of the muj˚hid˝n, N˚j˝ fell into some errors in his discussions on issues related to the takf˝r of parties who forcefully resist the Shar˝™ah and its laws. ˜e manhaj of the Salaf on this issue was described in D˚biq, issue 10 pages 56-57, issue 8 pages 43-46, and issue 6 page 19-20 (footnotes 3-4).THE REVIVAL OF JIH˜D IN BENGAL40to support the Khil˚fah and join the ranks of its soldiers in Bengal. ˜ey united their ranks behind a single Qurash˝ im˚m and did not fear the blame of the blamers who chose to remain behind, those who blindly held to organizations that had claimed ﬁMullah ‚Umar was the true Am˝rul-Mu™min˝nﬂ although he had been dead for years. Rather, he had been dead even before they started using him as an excuse not to unite the whole Ummah behind one single leader. ˜e muj˚hid˝n realized that the unity of the Ummah could only happen through a leader with true authority, not an unwise man in some unknown hiding place releas-ing outdated video messages with pledges of allegiance to a dead man and scolding others for not doing the same! ˜us, Allah  united the ranks of muj˚hid˝n in Bengal once again after they were fragmented. He  gave them the honor of becoming soldiers of the Khil˚fah upon the prophetic methodology, insh˚™all˚h.˜e Revival of Jih˚d through the Light of the Khil˚fahOn 14 Dhul-Hijjah 1436, by Allah™s grace, a security cell belonging to the soldiers of the Khil˚fah in Bengal assas-sinated an Italian crusader named Cesare Tavella on the streets of Gulshan in the city of Dhaka. ˜is noble deed shook the taw˚gh˝t of the land as well as the crusaders living there, as the assassination occurred within the ﬁDiplomatic Zoneﬂ of the ﬁcapital,ﬂ supposedly the most secure residen-tial area of the country.Only days later, on 19 Dhul-Hijjah 1436, by Allah™s grace, another security cell belonging to the soldiers of the Kh-il˚fah in Bengal targeted a Japanese citizen in the northern region of Rangpur. ˜ese blessed back-to-back attacks have caused havoc among the citizens of the crusader nations and their allies living in Bengal and forced their diplomats, tourists, and expats to limit their movements and live in a constant state of fear. Moreover, the powerful message of a uni˛ed Ummah working under the leadership of the Khil˚-fah, beautifully conveyed by these blessed attacks in a dis-tant region, has once again proven to the arrogant crusader nations that from Tunisia to Bengal, their crusader citizens will never enjoy any peace or security in any part of the Muslims™ lands, bi-idhnill˚h, as long as they continue to be at war with the Islamic State.Shaykh Ab˙ Muhammad al-‚Adn˚n˝ (ha˛dhahull˚h) Œ the o˘cial spokesperson of the Islamic State Œ said, ﬁO mu-wahhid˝n in Europe, America, Australia, and Canada– O muwahhid˝n in Morocco and Algeria– O muwahhid˝n in Khur˚s˚n and al-Qawq˚z– O muwahhid˝n everywhere upon the face of the earth– O brothers in creed– O peo-ple of wal˚™ and bar˚™– O patrons of the Islamic State– O you who have given bay™ah to the Khal˝fah Ibr˚h˝m ev-erywhere– O you who have loved the Islamic State– O you who support the Khil˚fah– O you who consider your-selves from amongst its soldiers and patrons– Your state is facing a new campaign by the crusaders. So O muwahhid, wherever you may be, what are you going to do to support your brothers? What do you wait for while the people have become two encampments and the heat of the war increases day by day? O muwahhid, we call you up to defend the Islamic State. Dozens of nations have gathered against it. ˜ey began their war against us at all levels. So rise O mu-wahhid. Rise and defend your state from your place wher-ever you may beﬂ [Indeed Your Lord if Ever-Watchful].He also said, ﬁO muwahhid, do not let this battle pass you by wherever you may be. You must strike the soldiers, pa-trons, and troops of the taw˚gh˝t. Strike their police, secu-rity, and intelligence members, as well as their treacherous agents. Ruin their sleep. Embitter their lives for them and busy them with themselves. If you can kill a k˚˛r American or European Œ especially the spiteful and ˛lthy French Œ or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other k˚˛r from the harb˝ kuˆ˚r, including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill them in any manner possible, regard-Cesare Tavella - The Italian crusader killed by the soldiers The streets of Gulshan in the city of Dhaka41less of the methodﬂ [Indeed Your Lord is Ever-Watchful].In addition, the Islamic State has warned the pagan nation of Japan against further endangering the lives of Japan™s cit-izens through Japanese support for the American crusade. D˚biq wrote the following, commenting on the arrogant decision of the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to sup-port the crusader coalition: ﬁPrior to Shinzo Abe™s thought-less pledge of support for this crusade, Japan was not on the list of priorities to be targeted by the Islamic State, but through Shinzo Abe™s foolishness, all Japanese citizens and interests Œ wherever they may be found Œ are now a target for the soldiers and patrons of the Khil˚fah everywhereﬂ [Is-sue 7, ﬁForeword,ﬂ page 4].˜us, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah in Bengal pledged their allegiance to the Khal˝fah Ibr˚h˝m (ha˛dhahull˚h), uni˛ed their ranks, nominated a regional leader, gathered behind him, dissolved their former factions, performed the neces-sary military preparations, and hastened to answer the order from the Islamic State leadership, by targeting the crusaders and their allies wherever they may be found.On 10 Muharram 1437, the day of ‚™, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah detonated a string of bombs on the Raf˝dah who had gathered for a large shirk˝ procession in front of one of their largest temples Œ known as ﬁHosseini Dalanﬂ Œ in the city of Dhaka. ˜e blessed operation was the ˛rst to target the R˚˛dah of Bengal for nearly 400 years. Over a hundred of these murtadd˝n were killed and wounded. Feeding oˆ the momentum from these blessed attacks, the muj˚hid˝n carried out a daring raid less than two weeks lat-er on 21 Muharram 1437, choosing to assault a group of policemen preparing to set up a checkpoint in an area in Dhaka. ˜ey stabbed one of them to death and wounded four others, and all praise is due to Allah.And while the soldiers of the Khil˚fah in Bengal are busy preparing for further attacks on the kuˆ˚r, by Allah™s permis-sion, the secular murtadd˝n of the present Awami League government continue to twist the facts on the ground and play a blame game in an eˆort to put political pressure on the murtadd˝n of both the nationalist BNP and the parlia-mentary ﬁJamaat-e-Islami.ﬂ Meanwhile, the soldiers of the Khil˚fah continue to rise and expand in Bengal, by Allah™s grace, and will continue to terrorize the crusaders and their allies until the rule of Allah is established on the earth.After months of arresting muwahhid˝n and falsely claiming more than once that they had arrested the ﬁtop IS-coor-dinatorﬂ for Bengal, the shameless, lying murtadd govern-ment came out right after the blessed operation of Tavella Cesare to say ﬁthere is no IS in Bangladeshﬂ! ˜ey repeated the same lie over and over like a broken record after each of the blessed operations performed by the soldiers of the Khil˚fah, all in a desperate eˆort to save face before the in-ternational community of kufr and hide their inability and the impotence of their law enforcement agencies to provide security to their crusader masters and R˚˛d˝ citizens.˜e murtadd Bengali government will soon realize, by Allah™s permission, that shamelessly denying facts on the ground and playing childish blame games with the murtadd opposition will be of no avail to them, as the Islamic State is indeed here to stay, insh˚™all˚h. It is here to stay in Sh˚m and Iraq. It is here to stay in Khur˚s˚n and al-Qawq˚z. And it is here to stay from Tunisia all the way to Bengal even if the murtadd˝n despise such. ˜e Khil˚fah will continue to expand further until its shade covers the entire earth, all the lands where the day and night reach, insh˚™all˚h. In the end, it is the responsibility of the Muslims in Bengal to support the Khil˚fah. It is also the duty of all muj˚hid˝n in Bengal who support the Islamic State to close their ranks, unite under the soldiers of the Khil˚fah in Bengal, and aid them in every possible way. Allah  said, {Indeed, Allah loves those who ˛ght in His cause in a row as though they are a [single] structure joined ˛rmly} [As-Saˆ: 4]. He  also said, {O you who have believed, ˛ght those near you of the kuˆ˚r and let them ˛nd in you harshness. And know that Allah is with the righteous} [At-Tawbah: 123]. ˜e Proph-et  also said, ﬁPerform jih˚d against the mushrik˝n with your wealth, your lives, and your tonguesﬂ [Sah˝h: Reported by Ab˙ D˚w˙d and an-Nas˚™˝ from Anas].May Allah  bless the muj˚hid˝n in Bengal, support them, and grant them continuous success so that they may be-come a source of strength and support for the oppressed Muslims in both Bengal and Burma. May Allah unite the ranks of the Muslims in every region under the shade of the Khil˚fah.THE REVIVAL OF JIH˜D IN BENGAL4243Indeed, He who taught us that {those who disbelieved are allies of one another} [Al-Anf˚l: 73] also taught us that {their violence among themselves is severe. You think they are together, but their hearts are diverse. ˜at is because they are a people who do not reason} [Al-Hashr: 14].So the kuˆ˚r Œ whether they are Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox Christians, whether they are Orthodox, Con-servative, or Progressive Jews, whether they are Buddhists, Hindus, or Sikhs, whether they are capitalists, communists, or fascists Œ they are ultimately allies of one another against Islam and the Muslims. ˜is is because Islam Œ the religion of truth and ˛trah Œ is the greatest threat to their religions of falsehood, all of which are at war with the inborn na-ture of man. ˜is is also because the taw˚gh˝t and daj˚jilah (plural of dajj˚l) of these false religions fear losing control of their ˇocks of blind sheep and the wealth contained in their wooly pockets. ˜is is also because the ˇocks of blind sheep fear losing their animalistic societies and carnal cul-tures that serve their lusts, desires, and doubts at the ex-pense of reviving and nurturing the ˛trah within their dead hearts. Accordingly, Islam is the greatest threat to all of their immediate ﬁinterestsﬂ and it only makes sense for them to unite into various coalitions against their common enemy.And yet, despite this, they continue to have partisan and sectarian animosity that reaches the level of war and blood-shed.1 {You will never ˛nd in the sunnah of Allah any change, and you will never ˛nd in the sunnah of Allah any alteration} [F˚tir: 43]. And they compete amongst each other as well to obtain the larger following of blind sheep and to continue to draw wealth from these followers to their own gluttonous pockets. ˜ey meanwhile never learn 1 For more on the animosity of the various religions, sects, and parties of kufr towards each other, read D˚biq, issue 9, pages 17-18.from the lessons of the past and decide instead to follow the footsteps of those nations who were destroyed by Allah  for their arrogance. ˜erefore, they will continue to get stung from the same hole multiple times.And so America intervened in Sh˚m after its failures in both Afghanistan and Iraq. And Russia followed the path of its Western brethren after its own disasters in Afghanistan and Chechnya. And both the crusader East and crusader West now are at odds over securing their separate interests in Sh˚m as they compete over inˇuence in the region. ˜e drunken brown bear Œ Russia Œ savagely but clumsily strikes here and there in a manner that has even confused Amer-ican analysts, think tanks, intelligence, and policy-makers. And while it is at war with its Western rivals in the Ukraine, it has decided to enter into yet another conˇict with the West, by targeting the Sahwah allies of America in Sh˚m. Meanwhile, it entered into new fronts against the Islamic State in both Sh˚m and Iraq after the revival of the battle-˛eld in Wil˚yat al-Qawq˚z.And so, the drunken brown bear Œ blinded by its blood-thirsty hubris Œ has decided to throw itself into the hunter™s trap.Shortly after the Russian airstrikes began, the resolute sol-diers of the blessed Sh˚m˝ Wil˚yah of Sayn˚™ succeeded in downing a Russian passenger plane, resulting in the deaths of 224 Eastern crusaders. ˜e operation exacted revenge upon the cross-worshippers for recently killing hundreds of Muslims in Sh˚m, including their women and children. And the Islamic State will continue to strike Russia until Shar˝™ah returns to all the lands of the Muslims usurped by the crusader Russians and until Russia pays the jizyah in humiliation.YOU THINK THEY ARE TOGETHER, BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE DIVIDED4344˜e Competition over ProxiesA traitor is among the most despicable of creatures in the eyes of mankind. No man likes a traitor. Even the most deviant and accursed k˚˛r cannot stand a traitor. Yet those chosen to be the allies and agents of the crusaders in the war against Islam and its Khil˚fah are always treacherous parties and individuals. ˜e individual from them might betray his religion today and betray his apostasy tomorrow for another form of apostasy. His religion is himself, his lusts, his de-sires, and self-interests. {Have you seen he who has taken as his god his own desire, and Allah has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil? So who will guide him after Allah? ˜en will you not be reminded?} [Al-J˚thiyah: 23].Yet America makes the repeated mistake of backing treach-erous allies who end up abandoning it when their interests collide. ˜ese allies decide then that aiding America no lon-ger ful˛lls their own desires and personal glories. America backed the taw˚gh˝t Saddam, Gadda˛, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Bashar, all of whom later worked to serve their own personal, partisan, and sectarian interests despite American orders otherwise. It backed the Iraqi R˚˛dah Œ the regime and militias Œ all of whom now exert themselves in their ser-vices to Khamenei of Tehran. ˜ey backed various nation-alist Afghan factions in the ﬁeighties,ﬂ many of whom later sought refuge in Iran, using it as a base in their nationalist wars. And the story goes on.And the internal conˇicts in the ranks of the crusaders and their allies continue to grow.˜e PKKIn Sh˚m, America™s biggest ally has been the PKK (Kurdis-tan Workers™ Party) front known as the YPG (People™s Pro-tection Units). Historically, the PKK is closer to Russia and the East. Abdullah Ocalan Œ a Nusayr˝ Kurd2 and founder of the PKK Œ was trained by the Russian KGB-FSB (the So-viet/Russian intelligence). ˜e Russian t˚gh˙t Putin himself was a former lieutenant colonel in the KGB and later be-came director of the FSB. ˜e PKK, unlike most Western nations, is not considered a terrorist organization by Russia and China, and ideologically, it has a Marxist background. For this reason, it currently draws Marxist volunteers from the West and East to the ﬁLions of Rojavaﬂ and the ﬁIn-ternational Freedom Battalionﬂ backed by the ﬁMarxist-Le-ninist Communist Partyﬂ of Turkey. And like the Russians who bomb non-military targets in Sh˚m, the PKK meth-odologically follow similar ﬁrules of engagement,ﬂ defying those supposedly propagated by the West. Hence, the PKK demolished entire villages, destroyed entire neighborhoods of homes, and displaced entire communities on an ethnic basis as was documented by the Western-oriented ﬁAm-nesty Internationalﬂ in its study of the PKK ﬁAutonomous 2 ˜e PKK and its links with the Nusayriyyah and the R˚˛dah were also mentioned by the murtadd Osman Ocalan Œ former senior member of the PKK and brother of Abdullah Ocalan Œ during an interview on ﬁ12 May 2015ﬂ with ﬁNiqashﬂ in which he said, ﬁ˜e PKK has become part of the Shiite Muslim movement and in particular, there is a strong Alawite stream inside the party – ˜is has taken the PKK closer to Iran and I believe the party now has friendly relations with Iran, al-Assad and al-Abadi.ﬂAdministrationﬂ operating in the northern countryside of Halab, al-Barakah, and ar-Raqqah. ˜e PKK works side-by-side with the murtadd Asad regime in the areas where they have a common presence in and around al-Q˚mish-l˝ and al-Hasakah. ˜ey back the regime militias in Nub-bul and az-Zahr˚™ with logistics. ˜e PKK had a history of also receiving support from Syria, Iran, and Russia against America™s apostate allies: Turkey and Saddam. Finally, the atheist PKK are at war with the murtadd regime of Turkey, which is a member of the anti-Russian NATO coalition.And what has angered America is that Russia has already of-fered its hand to cooperate with the PKK so as to reintegrate the PKK regions back into those of the Asad regime (most likely with some degree of autonomy). Government-backed Russian media even produced propagandist documentaries for the PKK on Russian satellite TV channels. Reports have also come out that the Syrian Baath party was permitted to open up branch o˘ces in Tall Abyad and other cities recently overtaken by the PKK. ˜is is not surprising, as the Asad regime utilized its close relationship with the PKK to quell any opposition to the regime in Kurdish regions early on in the ﬁSyrian Revolution.ﬂ˜e Free Syrian Army and Nationalist FactionsAfter the PKK™s service to America in Sh˚m comes that of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other nationalist factions, many of whose leaders were former Baathist o˘cers who never repented from apostasy, as joining a nationalist op-position is not repentance. Accordingly, in˛ltration of their various battalions was easy for the regime security appara-tus, hence the numerous handovers and ﬁreconciliationsﬂ especially in the regions surrounding Dimashq.3 Militias of unprincipled mercenaries are not di˘cult to change with cash and cigarettes. Russia Œ on behalf of the regime Œ has already oˆered to sit with the FSA, with this oˆer reportedly being considered by some FSA and nationalist elements in Dar™˚ and near Dimashq. Jordan Œ which backed the FSA ﬁSouthern Frontﬂ Œ has already declared its support for the 3 ˜ese areas of ﬁreconciliationﬂ were mentioned in D˚biq, issue 9, ﬁIn-terview with the Am˝r of the Yarm˙k Camp Region,ﬂ pages 66-73.for the murtadd PKK45Russian intervention. And because America raised its allies and agents to wage war against the Islamic State alone, ﬁre-gime changeﬂ is not the real goal of many of these factions. Accordingly, it is not problematic for such factions to turn towards the regime and Russia in pursuing a more strongly backed war against the Khil˚fah. If this ever occurs, these murtadd factions will not forget to also wage war against the murtadd˝n of the opposition formerly allied to them.Although such a change in allegiances is possible, it is un-likely to occur on a large scale unless America abandons these factions in favor of some other ﬁpoliticalﬂ mission in Sh˚m more in tune with the American religion.˜e Taw˚gh˛t˜e taw˚gh˝t of Jordan, the UAE, and Egypt have declared their support for Russian intervention in Sh˚m despite America™s position on the issue. ˜ese taw˚gh˝t belonging to the anti-ﬁrevolutionﬂ bloc prefer Asad to any of his opposi-tion even if his opponents are equally secular and murtadd, only because they fear that such ﬁrevolutionsﬂ might spill over into the lands usurped by these taw˚gh˝t. Again, the FSA ﬁSouthern Frontﬂ in Dar™˚ has had a strong relation-ship with Jordan and Jordanian intelligence, even oˆering condolences to the regime on the event of the Islamic State executing the Jordanian pilot Mu™˚dh al-Kas˚sibah. It is un-likely, though, that the declaration of support from these taw˚gh˝t leads to the taw˚gh˝t shifting sides, as they have been hooked on American aid for decades. It does however manifest the division of their hearts.As for the taw˚gh˝t of Turkey allied to America, they are al-ready knee-deep in a war with America™s PKK allies, whose ˛ghters are presently ˛lling the role of America™s ground forces. ˜e Turkish taw˚gh˝t have made early warnings of Russia™s plan to build up its relationship with the PKK and support them. And with Turkey being a NATO member, backing the PKK against the murtadd regime of Turkey would not be strange for the crusaders of Russia, especially considering that Russia had done so in its Soviet past.˜e PeshmergaAs for Iraq, then America™s closest ally there has been the Barzani Peshmerga, who are currently facing strong polit-ical opposition due to problems Iraqi Kurdistan is facing. ˜e Peshmerga have been split for years between the Amer-ican-backed ﬁKurdistan Democratic Partyﬂ (KDP) of Ma-soud Barzani and the leftist ﬁPatriotic Union of Kurdistanﬂ (PUK) of Jalal Talabani. ˜ese two parties were at war with each other in the ﬁnineties.ﬂ While Barzani sought the aid of the t˚gh˙t Saddam against the PUK, Talabani sought the aid of R˚˛d˝ Iran against the KDP. Eventually America got involved and forced the two sides to settle diˆerences and then later, after the American invasion of Iraq, it had the two sides form a government for Iraqi Kurdistan. Since then and since the various expansions in Iraq achieved by the Is-lamic State, there has been great turmoil in Iraqi Kurdistan. ˜e t˚gh˙t Barzani continues to hold onto power despite opposition from other Kurdish murtadd˝n. ˜e opposition consists mostly of the ﬁMovement for Changeﬂ (Gorran), a Kurdish party of apostates with roots in the leftist PUK and PKK. Gorran supports the PKK in both Syria and Iraq and accuses Barzani of being an agent of Turkey. ˜e PKK is equally supportive of Gorran™s opposition to Barzani. And similar to the war between the KDP and leftist PUK, the KDP and leftist PKK waged war against each other in Iraq in the ﬁnineties.ﬂ˜e turmoil in Iraqi Kurdistan reached the point of violent protests being launched by the leftist opposition in major cities. An economic crisis that led state workers to lose wag-es for a period of over three months was utilized as a rallying call. ˜e opposition blamed this on the ˛nancial corruption of the Barzani family and the KDP in general. Protesters stoned and torched KDP o˘ces. ˜e KDP responded by ˛ring at protesters and killing several, which got ﬁHuman Rights Watchﬂ involved in the campaign against the KDP. May Allah increase the animosity and violence between the murtadd˝n of the KDP, PUK, PKK, and Gorran.At any rate, this political turmoil is a danger to the Ameri-can mission in Iraq against the Islamic State. America pre-fers the t˚gh˙t Barzani for, contrary to the PKK, he does not currently have a mission to expand into Syria. ˜e PKK is also considered a terrorist organization by America and its allies. An expansionist agenda threatens the stability of the region and accordingly increases the fears of the mur-tadd government of the t˚gh˙t Erdogan, whose loyalty the Americans want to preserve.Meanwhile, there have already been reports from the Arab and Iraqi media on Barzani™s opposition moving slowly to-wards Russia in its war against the Islamic State. ˜e op-position to Barzani has showed a willingness to abandon the American mission in favor of the Russian mission, due to the long relationship between the leftist opposition and Soviet Russia.˜e turmoil in Iraqi Kurdistan is the true cause behind the raid by America and the Peshmerga on a prison in Wil˚yat Kark˙k. ˜e Americans wanted to save the face of Barzani and thereby grant him a stronger support base. ˜e ﬁrescueﬂ YOU THINK THEY ARE TOGETHER, BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE DIVIDED46of seventy Peshmerga soldiers would have granted Barzani a victory, one his opposition is unable to achieve. But the raid did not free a single Peshmergan. Instead, it led to the Americans detaining and killing several prisoners inside an Islamic State prison as well as the death of an American soldier. It was followed by the Islamic State executing four Peshmerga prisoners on camera.˜e R˚˝dah of Iraq and Iran˜e R˚˛dah of Iraq have considered Iran to have ultimate authority over them due to their belief in ﬁWil˚yat al-Faq˝h,ﬂ a creed which essentially dictates the so-called ﬁSu-preme Leader of Iranﬂ to be the top religious and political authority of the R˚˛dah everywhere. So as the Americans back the R˚˛d˝ regime of Baghdad and the R˚˛d˝ militias ˛ghting alongside it in the war against the Islamic State, it is strengthening regionally one of its historical foes Œ the Iranian regime. ˜e R˚˛d˝ regime has overrun major allies of the West in Yemen and Lebanon as it plots similar sce-narios for the Arabian Peninsula in Bahrain, Kuwait, and ﬁSaudiﬂ Arabia. So America is caught in a quagmire: Should it continue to support the murtadd R˚˛dah against the Is-lamic State, thereby further emboldening the R˚˛dah into carrying out revolutions elsewhere? Or should it adopt a policy of non-interference and just await the collapse of the R˚˛dah and the taw˚gh˝t at the hands of the Islamic State? ˜e hubris of the Americans has blinded them as it blinded the drunken brown bear, and so it prefers to interfere in a manner that will bring about its ultimate destruction.Here it is important to note that one of the religious te-nets of the R˚˛dah is taqiyyah, and that accordingly the time gained in their negotiations with the crusaders is like-ly for them to further develop and weaponize their nucle-ar program, something America claims to be against. Of course, such weapons would probably only be used against Ahlus-Sunnah in defense of the Jews who will follow the ﬁMahd˝ﬂ of the R˚˛dah.4 But Allah will protect the Mus-lims from the plots of the R˚˛dah.4 To read on the R˚˛d˝ account of the Mahd˝, see D˚biq, issue 11, ﬁ˜e Mahd˝ of the R˚˛dah,ﬂ pages 16-17.˜e Jewish StateDespite the rivalries between the R˚˛dah and the Jewish state, they have more in common with each other than any other religions of kufr. ˜ey both await a ﬁsaviorﬂ whom they allege will wipe out the followers of Allah™s Messenger . And the Russian intervention in Sh˚m has brought an opportunity for the R˚˛dah and the Jewish state to get clos-er to each other through Russia. Before executing its ˛rst round of airstrikes in Sh˚m, Russia contacted the Jewish state to warn it of Russian presence in the skies of Sh˚m. Pu-tin then met with Netanyahu in Moscow on ﬁ21 September 2015ﬂ to discuss the details of the attacks and coordinate their separate missions. In this regards, Zvi Magen Œ for-mer Israeli ambassador to Moscow Œ said to the Economist on ﬁ30 September 2015,ﬂ ﬁIsrael made clear to him [Putin] that we [the Jews] have no real problem with Assad.ﬂ At the same time, Russia promised to limit the Iranian inˇuence and that of Hizbull˚t (Hezbollah) in Sh˚m.Is it possible this relationship between the Jewish state and the R˚˛dah and the Nusayriyyah through Russia grows into something bigger while Netanyahu and Obama clash over American-Jewish relations and policies?What Has Changed?˜e believer might ask, what has changed after the Russian intervention? ˜e answer is that nothing has changed ex-cept that the opportunity for reward from Allah  is now greater. ˜e muj˚hid who was patient in the face of the cru-sader, t˚gh˙t˝, Nusayr˝, and R˚˛d˝ airstrikes gets closer to Allah  when he manifests patience in the face of more airstrikes from other crusader nations. ˜e soldiers of the Islamic State who were patient in the face of the overlap-ping but quarrelling crusader coalition and R˚˛d˝ coalition are not changed by the addition of Russia to one of the two anti-Islam coalitions, while realizing that Russia had always been a backer of the Nusayr˝ t˚gh˙t al-Asad.So are these events precursors to the prophesized truce be-tween the Muslims and the Romans? Will the West aban-don its support of the R˚˛dah, the murtadd taw˚gh˝t, and the Jewish state? And will the intervention of Russia in favor of Iran in Sh˚m and Iraq lead the West into a truce with the Khil˚fah? All one can say is that Allah knows best.And nothing changes for the Islamic State, as it will con-tinue to pronounce takf˝r upon the Jews, the Christians, the pagans, and the apostates from the R˚˛dah, the Nusay-riyyah, the Sahwah, and the taw˚gh˝t. It will continue to wage war against the apostates until they repent from apos-tasy. It will continue to wage war against the pagans until they accept Islam. It will continue to wage war against the Jewish state until the Jews hide behind their gharqad trees. And it will continue to wage war against the Christians until the truce decreed sometime before the Malhamah. ˜ereafter, the slave markets will commence in Rome by Allah™s power and might.May Allah continue to break and shatter the ranks of the k˚˛r coalitions and alliances all over the earth.American interests in the region47ﬁ15 months after the declaration of the Caliphate, the US-led campaign against it is more di˙used than ever, and there are many now in the West who are conceding that the Islamic State is a country that is here to stay.ﬂOn 31st March, issue 8 of D˚biq magazine published an article I wrote called ﬁParadigm Shift,ﬂ in which I exam-ined the depiction of the Islamic State in Western media and politics progressing from a mere ﬁorganizationﬂ to a real, functioning entity. A country, I called it. I know nothing about nation building. I™m so foolish I never even made it to university. But after dismissing some of the things I™ve written in the past as ﬁISIS propaganda,ﬂ many journalists and scholars in the West are now agreeing with this sentiment. ˜e Islamic State, they say, is a genuine state.˜is reality of the Caliphate is con˛rmed by many things, the people living under its governance, for one. For the ˛rst time in years, Muslims are living in security and their businesses are doing a roaring trade. ˜e zak˚h system has been up and running, taking a percentage of peoples™ wealth and dispersing it to the poor. ˜e gold dinar coins ˛rst mentioned a year ago are now being minted, in prepa-ration for their circulation. Shar˝™ah courts are established in every city and are judging by the laws of Islam. Corruption, before an unavoidable fact of life in both Iraq and Syria, has been cut to virtually nil while crime rates have considerably tumbled.Meanwhile the Gulf states all around are in turmoil. ˜ey are broken by religious diˆerences and fractured by an-cient tribal feuds. ˜e ﬁMiddle East – is broken, angry and so dysfunctional that it™s in a class all by itself, giving new meaning to the word ‚hopeless,™ﬂ wrote scholar Aaron David Miller in Foreign Policy on 11th September. ﬁIt is so torn apart and riven with sectarian, political, and religious hatreds and confrontations that it seems beyond the capaci-ty of any external party to remedy.ﬂ It™s precisely for reasons like this that the Islamic State has arisen so fast and in such a short space of time. ˜ere is only one sect here, Sunni Islam, and the Caliph can only be from one tribe, Quraysh. Here in the Caliphate, there is no room for pluralism.In an article published in ˜e Telegraph on 8th June, Ruth Sherlock wrote, ﬁ˜e jihadists have become fastidious bu-47PARADIGM SHIFT: PART II48reaucrats: imposing taxes [she refers to the zak˚h], paying ˛xed salaries and imposing trading standards laws [she re-fers to the banning of har˚m transactions] in a bid to create a healthy economy – many Syrian businessmen see ISIL as the only option when compared to the anarchy that prevails in areas controlled by other rebels, including West-ern-backed groups.ﬂ˜at™s a far cry from the barbarism generally used to paint the Islamic State in order to perpetuate the image of an evil entity, an image so convenient for government propaganda. What else, Ruth?ﬁDoctors and engineers, particularly those managing the ISIS-controlled oil˛elds, are paid handsomely Œ at least double, and often several-fold the salaries oˆered in other parts of the country,ﬂ she continued. ﬁBusinesses are now choosing to move their industry into ISIS areas.ﬂ˜at™s not me talking but a writer for one of the ﬁbetterﬂ newspapers in the UK. And this sentiment Œ that the Is-lamic State is a real, growing state Œ is increasing in vol-ume in the West. After one year of airstrikes all the evidence suggests there has been no ﬁrolling backﬂ of the muj˚hid˝n, any ﬁdegradationﬂ of their ˛ghting ability has been quickly re-supplied by fresh battle˛eld booty and new recruits, and estimates for the Islamic State™s army remain, according to the CIA, at 32,000 soldiers but with some ˛gures suggest-ing up to 70 or even 100,000 to be called upon if required. An unnamed US o˘cial told the Associated Press that US intelligence has ﬁseen no meaningful degradation in their numbers.ﬂOne year into their war and nothing has changed. ˜is pos-es a problem for the coalition.˜e Iraqi army, according to MIT University™s Barry Po-sen, no longer exists as a meaningful ˛ghting force. In Iraq they have been largely superseded by the Popular Mobili-zation Units (al-Hashd ash-Sha™b˝), a Shia militia of up to 100,000 men with weapons supplied by Iran. ˜ey led the assault on Tikrit in April and have been largely responsible for many of the atrocities subsequently reported in Sunni regions. But since Tikrit, there have been no notable victo-ries for the coalition, and the ˛ghting in Iraq is not going well, to the extent that Lieutenant General Robert Neller of the USMC, when asked by senator John McCain on how he considered the campaign to be progressing, replied, ﬁI think we™re doing what we need to do right now – I believe they are in a stalemate right now.ﬂ Far from ﬁrolling backﬂ the muj˚hid˝n, the Islamic State is holding ground or even advancing, as can be evidenced by the recent taking of new regions in Iraq and Syria.It is the requirement of the American government and its al-lies to verbally belittle the Islamic State in public comments by referring to it as just a terrorist ﬁorganization.ﬂ True, it is a functioning state that uses terror as a tool. But if it™s just an ﬁorganizationﬂ and the soldiers who ˛ght for it just terror-ists, this gives the public a hook on which to hang their hat. People understand the words ﬁterroristsﬂ or ﬁjihadistsﬂ and will largely support any military action against them. But it loses its urgency when you™re ˛ghting soldiers from a state. It just doesn™t conjure up the same images of extremely im-minent danger for a politician™s speechwriter. Fighting mere terrorists is one thing, ˛ghting a country, even if that coun-try takes pride in its terrorist tactics, is quite another. But to concede that the Islamic State is indeed a state in any spo-ken comment would be an admission of their victory that no political leader is currently prepared to make. So they deliberately continue to call them the ﬁso calledﬂ Islamic State, ISIL, IS, ISIS, Daesh and whatever the next nom de jour is in a move to show: ﬁPah. Fiddlesticks! We don™t even know what their name is. We™ve got this in hand.ﬂ˜at™s what they say in public. But what they say behind closed doors with their defence secretaries and intelligence chiefs will, I™m sure, be very diˆerent by now. According to Western reports, approximately 7 million people live in the Caliphate in an area larger than Britain and more pop-ulous than Denmark, and many of them are saying that life now is better than it was under the Assad and Shia-led regimes in Syria and Iraq and miles better than the corrup-tion and chaos that followed the Free Syrian Army. ˜at throws a spanner into the works. It™s not what one would expect from a bunch of supposedly ﬁwild-haired barbarianﬂ terrorists, surely?In the New York Times on 21st July, Tim Arango wrote, ﬁ[˜e Islamic State] has outdone the corrupt Syrian and Iraqi governments it routed, residents and experts say. ‚You can travel from Raqqa to Mosul, and no one will dare to stop you even if you carry $1 million,™ said Bilal, who lives in Raqqa, the Islamic State™s de facto capital in Syria. ‚No one would dare to take even one dollar.™ﬂArango continued, saying the Islamic State is putting in place more governing measures including ID cards for res-idents, promulgating ˛shing guidelines to preserve stocks, requiring that cars carry tool kits for emergencies and, of course, following the Shar˝™ah to the letter. ﬁ[A shop owner in Raqqa] said – ‚Here they are implementing God™s reg-ulations. ˜e killer is killed. ˜e adulterer is stoned. ˜e thief™s hands are cut.™ﬂ Stephen M. Walt, a professor of in-ternational aˆairs at Harvard, who was quoted in the same article, said, ﬁI think there is no question that the way to look at it is as a revolutionary state-building organization.ﬂA revolutionary state-building organization? ˜at doesn™t sound like just a terrorist ﬁgroupﬂ at all. It™s important to remember, as Walt explains elsewhere, that as new countries have been formed throughout history, it often took years before they were recognized by other states. He mentions, 49for example, that Europe refused to formally recognize the Soviet Union for years after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, the US not doing so until 1933. Likewise, Ameri-ca did not establish diplomatic relations with the People™s Republic of China until 1979, some 30 years after it was founded. ﬁIf the Islamic State manages to cling to power, consolidate its position, and create a genuine de facto state in what was previously part of Iraq and Syria,ﬂ concludes Stephen Walt, ﬁthen other states will need to work togeth-er to teach it the facts of life in the international system.ﬂ Well, not quite. ˜e Islamic State holds the ﬁinternational systemﬂ to be a t˚gh˙t, something evil enforcing manmade laws upon people. It will never ﬁlearnﬂ to ﬁworkﬂ with it. But a truce with Western nations is always an option in Shar˝™ah law.And here™s the thing. Assad is pretty much ˛nished, with the crumbling ruins of his despotic government now only controlling one-quarter of Syria. Iraq is a disjointed jumble of regions and tribes that never recovered from the Amer-ican invasion and cannot return to what it once was. ˜e Islamic State, straddling both countries as it does, is a Mus-lim empire, a country in which there are no tribal or reli-gious clashes. ˜ere is only one sect and only one creed. It is a place run, governed, and protected by Sunni muj˚hid˝n, and as such is now completely unique in the splintering, in˛ghting mess that is collectively referred to as the Middle East. By way of its singularism, it is a better model for future stability in the region than any of the Gulf states supported or shaped by Western intervention that have subsequently declared war upon it.Again, this isn™t just me saying this. ˜at would make it ﬁISIS propaganda,ﬂ and we can™t have that now, can we? Brigadier General Ronald Magnum made some interesting comments in a paper published by the Georgia Caucasus Strategic Studies Institute on 29th May.ﬁ˜e Islamic State meets all requirements – to be recog-nized as a state,ﬂ he said. ﬁIt has a governing structure, it controls territory, a large population, is economically viable, has a large and eˆective military and provides governmental services such as health care to its population. Dealing with it as if it were a terrorist movement is a non-starter. It is a State and if the West wants to defeat it, it must accept either: 1) ˜e Islamic State is enough of a threat to world or regional peace that the West is willing to go to war with it, or 2) ˜e costs of a war are too great and the West must plan to contain the Islamic State and ultimately negotiate with it as a sovereign State.ﬂFailed attempts by the coalition to ﬁcontainﬂ the Caliphate are already old news. But the N-word, negotiate? ˜at™s a bombshell. Just recently, Obama said there still ﬁwould be no negotiatingﬂ with the Islamic State, a fact not lost on my former cellmates. But then he changed his policy regarding that, so maybe he or the next president will have to change their policy on this.In a piece published in Foreign Policy on 10th June under the title ﬁWhat Should We Do if the Islamic State Wins?,ﬂ Professor Stephen Walt suggested that victory for the mu-j˚hid˝n could be considered not as them planting their black ˇag on top of the Empire State building, but as them retaining the territory they now control and not being ﬁde-graded or destroyedﬂ in any way. So far, they have achieved this. ﬁIt eventually moves from pariah to partner, especial-ly when its interests start to coincide with those of other states,ﬂ he wrote. ﬁIt may still be a troublesome presence in world politics, but it is no longer ostracized. If the Islamic State survives, that is what I™d expect to happen.ﬂ Again, Walt is making gross assumptions, as the muj˚hid˝n would never accept partnership with the West. But if Western na-tions want a truce, they really should think thrice before throwing away the chance.˜e West will need to continue doggedly dropping bombs and cajoling diˆerent groups of Shia into the killing zones on the ground for at least another year or two before any true consideration for a truce is reached. But it™s an inter-esting prospect, the West negotiating with the Islamic State. Is it really ever likely to happen? Jonathan Powell was chief negotiator on Northern Ireland for the Tony Blair govern-ment, and on 12th August, he spoke to the BBC about this very subject.ﬁIf you want to destroy the Islamic State, you™re not going to be able to do it from the air. And no one in the West seems prepared to put boots on the ground. So there is no military strategy for destroying ISIS. ˜ere needs to be a political strategy. In my view, that would involve talking to them,ﬂ he said.ﬁWe talked to the IRA, not because they had guns but be-cause they had a third of the Catholic vote. If you™re deal-ing with a group with no political support, such as Baad-er-Meinhof, you™re not going to negotiate because there isn™t a political question at the heart of the matter. And it seems to me likely there is a political question at the heart here in Syria and Iraq. If the conˇicts I™ve looked at over the last 30 years are anything to go by, and if ISIS have political sup-port, then we will end up speaking to them. Maybe they™ll fade like snow in the spring, but there is very little historical precedent for that happening in this sort of circumstance. It™s my hypothesis that there is such political support. And the idea of extreme Islamists – seems to have enough ro-bustness in it that there is a problem we™re going to have to address politically at some stage, not simply by force of arms.ﬂPowell concluded by saying the West has to pave the way for future ﬁtalksﬂ by ﬁestablishing a basic conversation.ﬂPARADIGM SHIFT: PART II50More than one year on from the start of the air campaign against the Islamic State and Martin Dempsey, the 4-star General in charge of the US-led campaign, must be won-dering what™s next. People in the West are impatient and demand results, and they™re not coming. Like Vietnam, the war against the Islamic State looks like it™s turning into a grinding war of attrition to try and reduce the enemy™s numbers without any clear goals set along the way.˜e bombs have certainly killed many muj˚hid˝n but more arrive to take their place every day, each one just as eager as the last to die a shah˝d for the sake of Allah. ˜e bombs have certainly destroyed many tanks and armoured vehi-cles of the Islamic State taken as booty from the Iraqi army (there™s only one gear in Iraqi army tanks: reverse) but the muj˚hid˝n have merely acquired more from the next ˇeeing unit. ˜e soldiers of the Caliphate have proved to be a force surprisingly resilient to the shatter and blast of a Paveway bomb or Hell˛re missile.And all the while, the Caliphate country they ˛ght and die to support has continued to grow and mature. ˜e mu-j˚hid˝n enjoy ˛ghting the most, but they have proved to be remarkably good at adapting to the needs of social re-quirements and government, too. Having established their country and set a new order in place within the Middle East, what happens over the next few years is more up to the Islamic State than any exterior force.˜e ˛rst option is that they continue to expand the borders of the Caliphate throughout the region until economic or military limitations stop them and they afterwards consol-idate their positions. Too bad for the West, it doesn™t look like such limitations exist for the Caliphate. ˜e second op-tion is that they goad the West into launching an all-out ground attack, thereby setting the scene for the ˛nal bat-tle between Muslims and the crusaders prophesized to be held at D˚biq in Syria, by conducting an operation overseas that is so destructive that America and its allies will have no alternative but to send in an army. ˜is would have to be something on the same scale, if not bigger, than 9/11. ˜en again, I™m just guessing. American ﬁhawksﬂ may very well come to D˚biq on their own without the Islamic State needing to blow up any dirty bombs in Manhattan.In a piece published in ˜e Independent on 21st June titled ﬁWe cannot destroy ISIS, so we will have to learn to live with it,ﬂ former counter-terrorism chief for MI6 Richard Barrett wrote, ﬁIraq and Syria will not return to how they were, and whatever it ends up calling itself, a new entity has emerged that will remain in some form. Currently that entity is aggressive, intolerant and uncompromising, but it is a truth that for all its dystopian features, ISIS oˆers those living under its rule better governance in some respects than they received from the state before it took over. Corruption is far less prevalent, and justice, albeit brutal, is swift and more evenly applied.ﬂ˜e Islamic State™s rapid consolidation and shrewd gover-nance of its territories has no doubt caught world leaders by as much surprise as its sudden blitz and capture of Mosul. If you™d told a politician in New York in June 2014 that by October 2015 the Islamic State would have achieved what they have, he™d have laughed in your face. It™s fair to say that the same politician isn™t laughing today.The blessed attacks on 9/1151On 25 Dhul-Qa™dah 1436, Ab˙ Fir˚s as-S˙r˝ Œ formerly of-˛cial spokesman of the Jawl˚n˝ front, currently a Jawl˚n˝ front leader and head of its ﬁshar™˝ academiesﬂ Œ published an article exposing the deviance of the Jawl˚n˝ front™s allies and consequently his own deviance and that of his party.

Ibl˝s then applied the appropriate makeup and gave the stipulations to the sam-m˚™˝n so that they could promote them. From amongst the demands they made in accordance with the desires of Shay-t˚n and his proxies were: – that operations are executed by Syrians alone and that the muh˚jir˝n are banished. ˜ey also refused to denounce the pacts they formerly released, doing so in service of Shayt˚n and his proxies.ﬂﬁLet us discuss these demands from a number of angles. Who is the real demander of these stipulations? Is the de-mand from the samm˚™˝n or from the intelligence appara-tuses of the apostate regimes behind these samm˚™˝n, the apparatuses these samm˚™˝n deal with?ﬂﬁFrom the pacts that these samm˚™˝n announced before Œ a pact they recently declared their continued commitment to and refusal to renounce Œ was a pact published due to instructions from Turkey and Qatar, resulting from West-ern requests. ˜e samm˚™˝n themselves admitted this in the presence of numerous leaders of the muj˚hid˝n, my poor self being amongst them. It becomes clear that the decla-rations and demands of the samm˚™˝n are nothing but an execution of the demands of the apostate states, who have behind them the centers of kufr and international masonry. So the demands of the samm˚™˝n are nothing but a demand from the apostates and the execution of the demand is done in obedience to the apostates, in line with their ranks. Can this be accepted by someone whose heart was touched by ˝m˚n or who tasted obedience to Allah?ﬂﬁAnd are these demands in accordance with the Shar˝™ah or in opposition to it? 1) ˜ere is no doubt they oppose it it was read on camera by the now dead Hass˚n ‚Abb˙d, former head of ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚m.ﬂ ˜e most deviant clauses in the covenant promise Œ verbatim Œ to target the regime and its allies alone (i.e. no targeting of Jews, Christians, the Druze, the Ism˚™˝liyyah, etc.), to rely militarily on Syrian people when forming military forces (i.e. no muh˚jir˝n), to estab-lish a state of justice, law, security, and freedom (i.e. no Shar˝™ah), while also providing such to the multi-religious Syrian people (including the B˚tiniyyah), and to respect ﬁhuman rightsﬂ! And yet the Jawl˚n˝ front co-operated with these apostate parties in the war against the Islamic State!from a number of angles – Unity of ranks is not viewed by them except through the eyesight of a chicken. ˜ey look to Syria as being the whole world – ˜ey then unify with the people of the American ‚Military Operation Coopera-tion™ room, the followers of America, the soldiers of Ibl˝s, and everyone upon whom the devils descend. 2) Accepting the stipulations of the samm˚™˝n also means approving or even partaking in their relationships and their receiving of instructions from the apostate states, and this is a man˚t3. 3) Accepting the stipulations of the samm˚™˝n also means approving of their seeking help from the kuˆ˚r, and this is not permissible according to the Shar˝™ah. 4) Accepting the stipulations of the samm˚™˝n also means approving of their restricting of jih˚d to the Syrian lands, a becalming message to the Jews. ˜is is not permissible according to the Shar˝™ah, and is a form of foul regionalism. 5) Accepting the stipulations of the samm˚™˝n also means approving of their safeguarding of apostate and heretical sects, and this is a man˚t. 6) ˜e rest of the disasters found in their pacts in-cluding the struggle to establish a state of justice, freedom, and law, and other deviances, are not hidden from anyone with a mind even if he is a layman in Shar˝™ah.ﬂHe then describes them as ﬁan ally whose decision is in the hands of apostate regimesﬂ and who are ﬁallied to the apos-tate regimes and groups. ˜ey blatantly call to what is de-manded from them by the kuˆ˚r and apostates. ˜is party with these traits leads the Jabhah [Jawl˚n˝ front] towards the camp of treachery.

So when the Jabhah unites with them in a single body, what applies to them applies to it, including the seeking of help from the kuˆ˚r and the submission to their conditions. ˜is contradicts the teachings of the reli-gion–ﬂﬁTo be brief, the samm˚™˝n are like a girl who lost her vir-ginity by having har˚m relationships with the apostate re-gimes behind her. She was irritated by every woman who preserved her honor, chastity, principles, and religion, and instead of repenting to Allah, she wants to entangle every chaste women so that they are like her in vileness.

Keep in mind that they gave refuge to the groups of Hazm and Ma™r˙f after our con-ˇicts with them. What is the diˆerence between the group of samm˚™˝n and between Zink˝ and Zahr˚n ‚All˙sh? Keep in mind that the samm˚™˝n are linked to ‚All˙sh through a coalition and strive to form a coalition with Zink˝ and its likes! All of them collect money from the outside. All of them follow agendas from the outside. And when the samm˚™˝n ally with people like these, it indicates that there is no diˆerence between them. And when the samm˚™˝n de-nounce the actions of the Jabhah against Jam˚l Ma™r˙f and Hazm, this means they are in the other camp. And when they take arms from Ma™r˙f™s group, claim that there is a se-cret bay™ah from Ma™r˙f™s group to them, and protect them from the Jabhah, this means they are in the other camp.ﬂﬁHazm, Jam˚l Ma™r˙f, the samm˚™˝n, Zink˝, and their likes are connected to foreign agendas. ˜ey all receive aid from the governments of apostasy and kufr. ˜e samm˚™˝n gave refuge to Ma™r˙f and Hazm and protected them from us. All of them execute what is dictated to them. But the master of all of them has not asked from the samm˚™˝n what he asked from Hazm and Ma™r˙f. ˜eir like is that of the scholars of the t˚gh˙t – What the t˚gh˙t of Syria and t˚gh˙t of Egypt demanded from their muftis, the Saudi t˚gh˙t did not demand initially. So the Saudi scholars appeared more acceptable. But when the Saudi t˚gh˙t demanded from its scholars the same as the other taw˚gh˝t, they executed what was required of them – Rather, they did so in a more harmful and dangerous way. ˜is is the exact diˆerence be-tween the samm˚™˝n and between Hazm and Ma™r˙f. All the movements that collect money Œ throughout history and to this day and age Œ have submitted to their masters and exe-cuted their orders when demanded. ˜ey will remain slaves to those who pay them.ﬂ4He then ends his article with poetry in which he refers to the factions as ﬁthe ambassadors of the Jews and crusader party 4 Editor™s Note: If ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚mﬂ are just like Ma™r˙f and Hazm, why did the Jawl˚n˝ front cooperate with ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚mﬂ against the Isla-mic State? It was nothing but hypocrisy and apostasy. Note: Ma™r˙f was a former ally of the Jawl˚n˝ front against the Islamic State. As for Hazm, it was not formed until shortly after the Sahwah, but many of its founding leaders were in the Free Syrian Army and nationalist factions of the wes-tern countryside of Aleppo. ˜e Jawl˚n˝ front cooperated with them in the Sahwah against the Islamic State before the formation of Hazm. It la-ter cooperated with the ﬁSh˚miyyah Frontﬂ against the Islamic State after the unrepentant Hazm dissolved into the apostate ﬁSh˚miyyah Front.ﬂIN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMYthe Islamic State54who seduce the people of chastity and purity. ˜ese ambas-sadors drive the missions of kufr to us while displaying love for the lands of Sh˚m – ˜ey are just the messengers of the enemies and apparatuses of the forces of apostasy.ﬂ˜is piece was followed by responses written by the Sahwah ﬁideologueﬂ Ab˙ Qat˚dah al-Filist˝n˝ and the Sahwah liar Ab˙ ‚Abdill˚h ash-Sh˚m˝ (a top leader of the Jawl˚n˝ front), both of whom criticized Ab˙ Fir˚s for his open criticism of ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚m.ﬂ Ab˙ Fir˚s responded by writing an article titled ﬁ˜e Bankrupt Ones.ﬂ In it he said, ﬁHe who read the response of my brother Ab˙ ‚Abdill˚h ash-Sh˚m˝ gets the impression that Ab˙ ‚Abdill˚h read my article on-line and had not known about it before! ˜e truth is that I showed the article to my brother Ab˙ ‚Abdill˚h ash-Sh˚m˝ two months before publishing it. It earned his praise – So why did he approve of it only to later censure it? Is it an independent opinion that he reached later, or pressure upon our brother Ab˙ ‚Abdill˚h ash-Sh˚m˝? Was he pressured so strongly? Allah knows best.ﬂAb˙ Fir˚s later criticizes Ab˙ ‚Abdill˚h ash-Sh˚m˝ for ig-noring the blatant remarks of deviance made by Ab˙ ‚Ab-dil-Malik ﬁash-Shar™˝,ﬂ Ab˙ Yazan ash-Sh˚m˝, Ab˙ Ayman al-Hamw˝, Ab˙ S˚riyah ash-Sh˚m˝ (all of whom are dead former leaders of ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚mﬂ), and Ab˙ J˚bir ash-Shaykh (former leader of ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚mﬂ), including their disavowal of international jih˚d, their readiness to co-operate with and even ˛ght alongside the k˚˛r states and apostate regimes, their protection of the apostate sects, their call for a state of justice, law, and freedom, their wish to support the apostate states in other wars, their endorsement of Turkish intervention in Sh˚m, and their desire to unite with the agents of kufr and enemies of Islam. After quoting these various leaders he says, ﬁMy words on the samm˚™˝n were based on facts. Before you are a selection of these facts. My words were not based on suspected outcomes.ﬂ5Of course, the retraction of stances is not new to Ab˙ ‚Abdill˚h ash-Sh˚m˝, as he had before labelled ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚mﬂ to be the ﬁFuture Hamasﬂ (referring to the devi-ant methodology of Hamas and their ruling by manmade laws).6 And although Ab˙ ‚Abdill˚h criticized Ab˙ Fir˚s, he himself had made similar albeit less explicit statements about the Syrian factions in his response to at-Tart˙s˝ and his interview with ﬁAl-Man˚rah al-Bayd˚™.ﬂ His leader Œ Jawl˚n˝ Œ had called ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚mﬂ ﬁthe sahw˚t of the 5 Editor™s Note: All but one of the apostates he quotes are from the dead former leadership of ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚m.ﬂ Also, the various pacts he refers to were all written in the time of these dead leaders and signed by them. So why was he critical of the Islamic State for pronouncing takf˝r of ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚mﬂ and their allies? And why did he himself cooperate with ﬁAhr˚r ash-Sh˚mﬂ against the Islamic State!6 Editor™s Note: See D˚biq, issue 10, ﬁInterview with Ab˙ Sam˝r al-Ur-dun˝ (former member of Jawl˚n˝™s sh˙r˚ council),ﬂ page 75.futureﬂ7 and criticized the factions for receiving aid from the crusaders and taw˚gh˝t because there is no such thing as unconditional aid, as he himself declared in his last inter-view with Al Jazeera.What we see before us are the signs of the ultimate collapse of the Jawl˚n˝ front. Its top leaders publically denounce the extreme deviance of their closest allies, criticize each other, and accuse each other of lies, disobeying orders, and not respecting nor abiding by sh˙r˚. ˜ey ˇatter the other sah-w˚t, fearing that they might turn on them, after serving them in their treachery against the Islamic State. ˜ey ex-pose the reality of the other sahw˚t, that they are agents of the crusaders and the taw˚gh˝t, showing that the Jawl˚n˝ front knew this all along through their close relationship and closed door meetings with the Sahwah leaders. But because of the jih˚d claimants™ irj˚™, the various forms of apostasy their allies fall into do not merit takf˝r nor war! And so they cooperate with these apostate allies against the Islamic State, thereby drowning themselves in the depths of apostasy.8May Allah continue to expose the Sahwah apostates, in-cluding the Jawl˚n˝ front, until there does not remain a sin-gle mustard seed of doubt about them in the hearts of the Muslims.7 Editor™s Note: See previous footnote.8 Editor™s Note: For more, see D˚biq, issue 8, ﬁIrj˚™: ˜e Most Dangerous Bid™ah,ﬂ pages 39-56.55Ab˙ Junaydah, whose parents are from Morocco, grew up in the crusader country of Germany. Like most youth from migrant families, he was somewhat distant from his religion despite his father and mother both then being re-ligious Muslims. And although life in d˚rul-kufr led many Muslim youth to abandon the daily prayers, Ab˙ Junayd-ah was an exception. No matter what he faced in life, he would never forget sal˚h.When he was a child, his father made him memorize some of the Qur™˚n and go with him to the masjid. When he grew older, he appreciated this discipline as due to it, he had learned much of the book of Allah.And so Allah guides whomever He wills and He showed His mercy towards Ab˙ Junaydah, guiding him to serious practice at the age of eighteen. He began to learn his reli-gion on his own eˆort and distance himself from all bad inˇuences. He also married early to protect himself from the traps of zin˚. Shortly after, Allah bestowed him with a daughter, whom he named Junaydah.Saddened by the events in Sh˚m and the crimes commit-ted against Ahlus-Sunnah, he resolved to perform hijrah there to partake in the jih˚d.In ﬁ2013,ﬂ he travelled to Sh˚m and joined the faction called ﬁJun˙d ash-Sh˚m,ﬂ led by the deviant liar Muslim ash-Sh˝sh˚n˝. Upon arrival, Ab˙ Junaydah was very hap-py to have arrived to the lands of jih˚d, but he quickly found out that not every ﬁmuj˚hidﬂ and not every ﬁjih˚d˝ﬂ faction is on the sound manhaj. He and the other mu-j˚hid˝n were forbidden from pronouncing takf˝r upon the t˚gh˙t Erdogan and the other taw˚gh˝t of Turkey for rea-sons of ﬁmaslahah.ﬂ Similarly, they were forbidden from pronouncing takf˝r upon the ﬁFree Syrian Armyﬂ (FSA). He witnessed how he himself as well as the Islamic State were strongly criticized for this. ˜ere were also many sit-uations in which the law of Allah was violated by the local factions; the people weren™t being judged by the Shar˝™ah. In one of these cases, for example, a local person insult-ed Allah (ta™˚l˚) and did not receive punishment for his crime.While he was with Jun˙d ash-Sh˚m, he was joined by his best friend Ab˙ Luqm˚n al-Alm˚n˝ and Ab˙ Junaydah™s cousin Ab˙ Hafs al-Alm˚n˝ in order to wage jih˚d against the taw˚gh˝t everywhere and their allies. But Ab˙ Luqm˚n and Ab˙ Hafs did not stay long with Jun˙d ash-Sh˚m, as they quickly recognized the corrupt and deviant manhaj of the faction and understood that they should join the Jam˚™ah. ˜us they both gave bay™ah to Am˝rul-Mu™min˝n Ab˙ Bakr al-Husayn˝ al-Baghd˚d˝ (ha˛dhahull˚h), joining the Islamic State.On the day of the Sahwah treachery, Ab˙ Luqm˚n and Ab˙ Hafs were captured by the FSA and imprisoned with hun-dreds of other muh˚jir˝n. But they deceived their captors into releasing them. ˜is led them to meet Ab˙ Junaydah again, who had abandoned Jun˙d ash-Sh˚m for the Jawl˚n˝ front shortly before the Sahwah. He began to work in the Jawl˚n˝ front™s media department.Because of Ab˙ Sulaym˚n the Australian™s lies, Ab˙ Junay-dah had some misconceptions about the Islamic State, but his heart was longing to join the Jam˚™ah, to be on its side while the whole world had assembled against it militarily, politically, economically, and even in the media realm. He also began catching many contradictions in the claims of Ab˙ Sulaym˚n the Australian and his Sahwah comrades against the Islamic State. In addition to this, Ab˙ Hafs Œ who was stuck in Halab after his release from the early Sah-wah prisons Œ would regularly advise Ab˙ Junaydah to join the Islamic State.And Allah guides whomever He wills. Ab˙ Junaydah lis-tened to the speeches of the senile and deviant Dhaw˚hir˝ and those of the former war minister of the Islamic State, Shaykh Ab˙ Hamzah al-Muh˚jir . He listened to their AMONGST THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN5556speeches about the Islamic State in order to form his own opinion on the matter of the Islamic State and Q˚™idah. He quickly realized that the new leadership of Q˚i™dah was al-together lying to the Ummah. ˜us, he decided to leave for Kafar Hamrah with his cousin Ab˙ Hafs so as to join the Islamic State.Once he arrived, he immediately went for rib˚t, to partake in the battle against the treacherous sahw˚t. Together with the other soldiers of the Islamic State, they opened up the path to withdraw to I™z˚z and then al-B˚b.After arriving in al-B˚b, Ab˙ Junaydah went with his cousin to ar-Raqqah to bring his family back to Sh˚m, as some brothers had sent their wives and children away from the harm of the sahw˚t during the chaos that followed the launching of the Sahwah conspiracy.Shortly after, Ab˙ Junaydah was tasked with many da™wah projects but he always wanted to return to ˛ghting. He longed for his cousin and wanted to be together with him again. Ab˙ Hafs had partaken in the battles near Sirr˝n against the sahw˚t of Liw˚ ˜uww˚r ar-Raqqah, who are led by the former Jawl˚n˝ front leader As˚ ar-Raqqah. He also participated in the battles against the sahw˚t of al-Khayr, who were led by the Jawl˚n˝ front leader Ab˙ M˚ri-yah al-Har˚r˝. He was treacherously murdered in the sum-mer of ﬁ2014ﬂ by Har˚r˝™s ﬁsoldiersﬂ in a drive-by shooting inside one of the liberated towns of al-Khayr. May Allah accept him.Ab˙ Junaydah was very much saddened but he remained committed to his work and tried to explain to his relatives and family that Ab˙ Hafs had given his blood for the estab-lishment of the Khil˚fah and that it was the greatest wish of them both that their families perform hijrah to the Islamic State. By Allah™s grace, his sister followed his example as she did not want to remain any longer in a country involved in waging war against Islam, the Muslims, and the Khil˚fah.Despite his da™wah work and despite him having two wives and children for whom he cared, he participated in many battles against the apostates. He took part in the battles of ‚Ayn al-Isl˚m, Tadmur, and M˚ri™, where he ˛nally achieved what he had for so long been yearning for, shah˚dah. Cru-sader planes came to the aid of the sahw˚t of Halab Œ the allies of Q˚™idah in Sh˚m Œ and struck a position where he was performing rib˚t on the outskirts of M˚ri™. He was killed instantly, during the most blessed days of the year, the ˛rst ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. ˜e Prophet  said, ﬁNo deeds are as good as deeds done in these ten days.ﬂ ˜ey asked him, ﬁNot even jih˚d?ﬂ He replied, ﬁNot even jih˚d, except for a man who endangers himself and his wealth [in jih˚d], and returns with nothingﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˚r˝ from Ibn ‚Abb˚s]. ˜is hadith was one he chose to narrate to brothers while on his way to M˚ri™.May Allah unite him and his cousin in Paradise and allow us to follow them. May Allah look after his family and pro-tect his children in the shade of the Khil˚fah, so that they only live by tawh˝d and so that they are amongst the ranks of Prophet s˚  when he descends to lead the armies of the Muslims.Junaydah57kindness, his zeal toward any task he undertook, his subtle sense of humor, his insight and understanding concerning matters related to religion, and his close commitment to parents and family.When the dream of khil˚fah became a reality presenting the chance to perform hijrah to a land where the Shar˝™ah of Allah and the Sunnah of His beloved Messenger would be revived and upheld, there was nothing that could hold him back from answering the call. As occurred with many others, it felt as though his entire life seemed to lead him to this moment. Hijrah however is no easy task. As is the case with all other acts of worship that are beloved to Allah, Shayt˚n stands diligently in the way. His parents recall him having said during all the trials they faced before embarking upon hijrah, ﬁ˜is is it for me. I want to have nothing of this Duny˚.ﬂ Allah the All-Hearing blessed him with not only the opportunity to perform hijrah himself, but to lead a party of sixteen others from among his closest family members, including his parents, wife, and six chil-dren. ˜is is a blessing so rare among the muh˚jir˝n of the Islamic State.Ab˙ Shurayh rarely ever missed qiy˚m al-layl. And throughout the last month of his brief life in the bless-ed month of Ramad˚n, he led his family in tar˚w˝h ev-ery evening, with his beautiful recitation of the Qur™˚n. He also volunteered for many night shifts in Ramad˚n at rib˚t checkpoints despite his demanding daytime respon-sibilities in da™wah. ˜e niyyah to be on guard and defend d˚rul-Isl˚m never left his heart, which is the essence of rib˚t. He was a mur˚bit regardless of his job and where-abouts. He also participated in battles for the T3 gas ˛elds and Jazal, both in Wil˚yat Hims.Having had the opportunity to serve the Khil˚fah, through the favor and grace of Allah, and doing his duty towards his family particularly his children by bringing them from d˚rul-kufr to d˚rul-Isl˚m, where they will thrive and grow to serve and ˛ght for Allah™s religion, by Allah™s permission, Ab˙ Shurayh as-S˝l˚n˝ attained shah˚dah by a Nusayr˝ air-strike on the city of ar-Raqqah, outside the masjid, after maghrib prayer, during the ten most blessed nights of the year, on the 25th night of Ramad˚n 1436. ˜ere was one airstrike, so he returned to the masjid to check for any ca-sualties, and on the way he was killed by a second strike.May Allah accept Ab˙ Shurayh and have mercy on him and all those who gave their life, wealth, and time for the cause of Allah, those whose actions continue to inspire and awaken this Ummah, by Allah™s permission.From a remote corner of a tiny dot on the map that rep-resents the island of Sri Lanka, better known among most Arabs as ﬁS˝l˚n,ﬂ and famous around the world for its deli-cious tea, came a young man known in the Islamic State as Ab˙ Shurayh as-S˝l˚n˝.Ab˙ Shurayh  showed great enthusiasm towards religious studies from a very young age. Even as a young man, he would stand strong and ˛rm when confronted by various people of bid™ah in matters of ‚aq˝dah. After completion of his studies in Sri Lanka, he continued on in the study of Shar˝™ah abroad. His kindness, devotion, and deep concern for the Ummah seemed always to move him in a diˆer-ent direction away from the mundane worldly desires and concerns of most people. Having grown up in a village, he despised life in the city and always preferred to keep things bare and simple. He was also an advocate for physical ˛t-ness and was a master of martial arts, for which he was re-nowned. When he left Sri Lanka to perform hijrah, he had a prestigious job in the suburbs. ˜rough his travels and his own enthusiasm for understanding the matters of religion, he gained pro˛ciency in the Arabic and Urdu languages, apart from being ˇuent in English and the native languag-es spoken in Sri Lanka. It was neither strange nor rare for him to engage in conversation with the local people of ar-Raqqah, enjoining good and forbidding evil, giving da™wah, and clearing any doubts or apprehensions they might have regarding the newly established Khil˚fah.For Ab˙ Shurayh , the concepts of hijrah and jih˚d, the return of the Khil˚fah, the great battles that will be fought and won, the return of Prs˚ , among other relat-ed topics were regular conversation with close family and friends. He grew up with the dream that he would live to see the unravelling of those events that we only read and hear about from the books of had˝th. He was among the few that strongly believed that those times were not far. He was loved and respected among family and friends for his 57AMONGST THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN585959INTERVIEW60˜is month, D˚biq had the opportunity to interview a muj˚hid stationed in Somalia who has given bay™ah to the Khal˝fah (ha˛dhahull˚h). We present our questions and his responses below.1D˚biq: How is the support for the Khil˚fah on the ground in Somalia?Abˆ Muh˚rib: Alhamdullil˚h, the situation in Somalia is currently very ˇuid and fast moving, with several groups already defecting from Harakat ash-Shab˚b in southern So-malia and others waiting. Groups in northern Somalia have also openly declared bay™ah. Some groups at the present stage cannot openly declare bay™ah due to security reasons and other factors. However, there is a phase of coordination and cooperation currently being undertaken in order to achieve a synchronized media eˆort, tactical maneuvering of forces, and securing of logistics to achieve strategic aims. Insh˚™all˚h, this will be soon.D˚biq: Are there regions in Somalia outside the control of the apostate government and the crusaders? What is the military situation on the ground? Who are the major ene-mies to the jih˚d mission in the region?Abˆ Muh˚rib: Currently there is a crusader AMISOM (African Union Mission in Somalia) presence in Somalia backing the apostate government. ˜ere are regions outside the control of the apostate government and the crusaders which are either with Harakat ash-Shab˚b or are eˆectively a ﬁno man™s landﬂ Œ this being mainly in the countryside Œ with a tribal presence but limited or no presence of either the movement or the government.˜e main enemies to the jih˚d mission in the region are AMISOM Œ mainly Ethiopians, Kenyans, Ugandans, and Burundians who also oppress the Muslim populations liv-ing in those lands Œ their murtadd lackeys in Somalia, and the Americans via their surveillance, drone program, and logistical support for their proxies.D˚biq: Why is Harakat ash-Shab˚b still with al-Q˚™idah? What is their opinion on Dhaw˚hir˝™s leadership of al-Q˚™idah? Do they believe as Dhaw˚hir˝ believes that the laymen R˚˛dah, Morsi, the Hamas government, and the nationalist and Saudi sahw˚t are ﬁMuslimsﬂ?Abˆ Muh˚rib: Harakat ash-Shab˚b™s choice of still being with al-Q˚e soldiers at all levels, hence the current continuing reality of mass defec-tions and political turmoil. ˜is outcome is the result of the leadership contradicting its o˘cial rhetoric of working for the revival of khil˚fah. It did this by refusing advice and ignoring the appeals of its soldiers to give bay™ah when the Khil˚fah was ˛nally established. ˜is matter has reinforced 1 Note: ˜is interview was held before the recent wave of bay™˚t from various Shab˚b groups and individuals to the Islamic State. Accordingly, the situation on the ground has changed signi˛cantly since then.the notion that the jih˚d of the Shab˚b leadership was more for the sake of hizbiyyah and taql˝d rather than ˛ghting for the clear shar™˝ objective.˜e leadership o˘cially endorses Dhaw˚hir˝ in general. However, individual leaders may not hold his deviant views with regards to Morsi, Hamas, the R˚˛dah, or the Sahwah. ˜is highlights the fact that their supposed relationship with al-Q˚™idah is merely a political game to protect the authority of the Shab˚b leadership currently in control of the movement.D˚biq: How have the ﬁGeneral Guidelines for Jih˚dﬂ by Dhaw˚hir˝ aˆected the jih˚d in Somalia? Does Harakat ash-Shab˚b follow the feeble policies he orders?Abˆ Muh˚rib: In reality, it has no eˆect because the Shab˚b leadership sees Dhaw˚hir˝ as simply a symbolic ˛gure who has no real control of aˆairs. Internally, Shab˚b policy mak-ers act independently in accordance with alleged interests. Like I said before, the bay™ah to al-Q˚™idah and being un-der Dhaw˚hir˝ are used as a political tool by the leadership to sideline and dismantle internal political strife. Examples of this include the dissolving of the Sh˙r˚ body under the pretext of ﬁtaking ordersﬂ from al-Q˚™idah, and on the other side of the coin, ﬁWe can™t be under the Khil˚fah as we are under Dhaw˚hir˝–ﬂD˚biq: Does the Shab˚b leadership consider the Islamic State to be Khaw˚rij? What is their stance towards the Tali-ban hoax and the concealment of Mull˚ ‚Umar™s death?Abˆ Muh˚rib: Only a few leaders may consider the Islamic State to be Khaw˚rij, but this is not the mainstream view. As for the Taliban hoax, then it was severely embarrassing for the Shab˚b leadership, as they had no explanation for it. ˜is also reinforced the confusing paradigm that existed for years for which there was never a real explanation. I refer to the Shab˚b-under-Dhaw˚hir˝-under-Taliban paradigm, a concept never comprehended by the Shab˚b soldiers.confusing leadership structure61Locally the Shab˚b Œ in certain matters Œ acted as an Islamic emirate, such as the bay™ah to its leader being considered w˚jib and the policy of killing any armed opposition or di-visive defection. In other issues, it acted as an organization, as being an o˘cial branch of al-Q˚™idah. And in other mat-ters, they possessed their own independent policies on the ground. So what was the role of Mull˚ ‚Umar in all of this? Was his opinion ever sought on any matter? Or is he yet an-other symbolic ˛gure? Why was the bay™ah not simply given to him if he was truly the supreme leader for all these years? Why was it instead given to the Shab˚b leader?˜e Taliban hoax and the bay™˚t by al-Q˚™idah to a dead man highlighted the deception that al-Q˚™idah regional leaders are capable of.D˚biq: Do you have any criticism of the manhaj of the Shab˚b leadership?Abˆ Muh˚rib: ˜ere is no criticism of the o˘cial manhaj of Harakat ash-Shab˚b upon which it was founded. How-ever, I believe the leadership should fear Allah with regards to abandoning their founding principles and fanatically holding onto personal opinions and hizbiyyah. ˜ey should not forget what happened to the jih˚d factions in Iraq and Sh˚m who followed such a path. We seek refuge with Allah from such befalling them. It should also be noted that at the height of its power and consolidation, the movement did not implement the Shar˝™ah fully when it had the ability to do so. For example, it never fully banned qat (a narcotic drug chewed by some locals) and implemented a number of questionable policies all in the name of a loosely de˛ned ﬁmaslahahﬂ and to preserve ﬁpopular support.ﬂD˚biq: How does Harakat ash-Shab˚b deal with the Mus-lims and muj˚hid˝n who give bay™ah to the Khil˚fah? How is the drive towards bay™ah to the Islamic State?Abˆ Muh˚rib: Firstly, it is the known policy of the Shab˚b leadership to kill any armed group who defects from their movement or anyone who is perceived to have destabilized the unity of the soldiery under their hold. Secondly, af-ter the Khil˚fah announcement, they have utilized several methods to deter, oppress, and terrorize those muj˚hid˝n in their ranks who support the Khil˚fah. ˜ese methods include imprisoning the Khil˚fah supporters, raiding their houses to cause them fear, isolating them, and using ˛nan-cial punishments such as cutting allowances for their fami-lies as a pressure tactic to force them to compromise. Sadly, these allowances were raised from Muslims for the sake of jih˚d, not for the purpose of waging a campaign against the Khil˚fah.˜ey have also forced many muj˚hid˝n to attend their ﬁshar™˝ﬂ courses in an attempt to create doubts about the Khil˚fah amongst the soldiers. ˜ey have also several times banned distribution of Islamic State videos but reversed this ban due to the sheer popularity of the Islamic State™s media. ˜rough their security department, they have made intim-idating phone calls and threatening SMS messages to vari-ous Khil˚fah supporters. Despite all this, the drive towards bay™ah is phenomenal and is maintaining an explosive pace. ˜e soldiers continue to take the risk and defect, seeking to join any of the newly formed Khil˚fah battalions.D˚biq: A lot of muh˚jir˝n have left Somalia, some of them coming to Sh˚m for the Islamic State. What is the reason for this? Do they continue to leave Somalia for Sh˚m?Abˆ Muh˚rib: Since the announcement of the Khil˚fah, many muh˚jir˝n have left to Sh˚m and Yemen, while others had also been trying to leave. ˜e strongest reason was the issue of the Khil˚fah and the Shab˚b leadership not giving bay™ah. As for those entering Somalia now and those re-maining here, then the bulk of these muh˚jir˝n are from the neighboring East African countries, as the closest place for them to perform hijrah to is Somalia.D˚biq: What is the attitude of the Muslim commoners in Somalia towards the Khil˚fah? What is the attitude of the soldiers and leaders of Harakat ash-Shab˚b towards the Is-lamic State?Abˆ Muh˚rib: ˜e scholars, knowledge seekers, and many of the commoners support the Khil˚fah and are immensely excited about it. ˜e vast majority of the Shab˚b soldiers support the Khil˚fah. However, the Shab˚b leadership fears and despises it.D˚biq: How was the reaction of the Shab˚b leadership to-wards the ˛tnah video of the hizb˝ ‚Azz˚m al-Amr˝k˝ that was leaked online in which he openly but indirectly criti-cized them?Abˆ Muh˚rib: ˜e leadership criticized the leaked video as being made by someone who did not know the ground re-alities despite their claim that they are under al-Q˚™idah. No doubt the Khur˚s˚n˝ ﬁleadershipﬂ knows very little about INTERVIEWdrug used by populations in 62the situation here in Somalia, still the ˛tnah video sank the Shab˚b soldiers further into confusion with regards to the relationship between ash-Shab˚b and al-Q˚™idah.D˚biq: Do you have advice for Harakat ash-Shab˚b and the Muslim commoners in Somalia?Abˆ Muh˚rib: My advice is for everyone to ful˛ll the ob-ligation and give bay™ah to the Khal˝fah, Am˝rul-Mu™min˝n Ab˙ Bakr al-Husayn˝ al-Baghd˚d˝, to be with the Jam˚™ah and the Im˚m of the Muslims. Allah  said, {And hold ˛rmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become mr˚n: 103].

While many continue to do so by undertaking hijrah to the Is-lamic State, others do so by de˚antly terrorizing the crusaders in their very strongholds. Such was the case on the 20th of Safar when Syed Rizwan Fa-rook and his wife Tashfeen Malik car-ried out an attack on the ku˛˜r in San Bernardino, California and succeeded in killing 14 of them and wounding 22 more. As the operation took place, Tashfeen Malik made a post online rea˝rming their bay™ah to Am˙rul-Mu™min˙n, Shaykh Abˆ Bakr al-Bagh-d˜d˙ (ha˚dhahull˜h). She and her hus-band then engaged in a shootout with security forces and were killed, thereby attaining shah˜dah in the path of Al-lah. We consider them so, and Allah is their judge. ˇus, the Khil˜fah™s call for the Muslims to strike the crusad-ers in their own lands was answered once more, but on this particular oc-casion the attack was unique. ˇe muj˜hid involved did not su˝ce with embarking upon the noble path of ji-h˜d alone. Rather, he conducted the operation together with his wife, with the two thereby aiding one another in righteousness and taqw˜. Allah  said, {ˇe believing men and believing women are allies of one an-other. ˇey enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey Al-lah and His Messenger. ˇose Œ Allah Forewordwill have mercy upon them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise} [At-Tawbah: 71]. ˇe Prophet  said, ﬁMay Allah have mercy upon a man who gets up at night and prays and then wakes up his wife who then prays, and if she refuses, sprinkles wa-ter on her face. May Allah have mercy upon a woman who gets up at night and prays and then wakes up her hus-band who then prays, and if he refuses, sprinkles water on his faceﬂ [Reported by Abˆ D˜wˆd, an-Nas˜™˙, and oth-ers from Abˆ Hurayrah]. If this is the du™˜™ of the Prophet  for a husband and wife who aid each other in getting up for qiy˜m al-layl, how much more deserving of Allah™s blessing are a hus-band and wife who march out togeth-er to ˚ght the crusaders in defense of the Khil˜fah! And the brother™s bless-ed wife accompanied him despite the fact that combat is not even obligatory upon her, but she did not want to lose the opportunity for shah˜dah at a time when many ﬁmenﬂ of the Ummah have turned away from the obligation of ji-h˜d.Add to this that they were not held back by the Duny˜ from ful˚lling their obligation to Allah, and proved that they were ready to sacri˚ce what The San Bernardino attack caught America o˜-guardFOREWORD  KILL THE IM˚MS OF KUFR  FROM THE PAGES OF HISTORY: THE SAFAWIYYAH  MILITARY REPORTS  HIKMAH  AMONG THE BELIEVERS ARE MEN  TO OUR SISTERS: ADVICE ON IHD˚D  DO THEY NOT THEN REFLECT ON THE QUR™˚N  THE R˚FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA™ TO THE DAJJ˚L  IN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMY  INTERVIEW WITH THE W˚L˛ OF KHUR˚S˚N  4was dearest to them for the sake of re-sponding to Allah , for not only did they leave behind their comfortable lifestyle, but prior to the operation they left their baby daughter in the care of others knowing that they likely wouldn™t see her again in this life. Such sacri˚ces mirror the hardship and di˝-culty faced by so many Muslims who have embarked upon the path to make hijrah to the lands of jih˜d. Many were forced to make a choice to either leave behind their comfort and luxury, their families and friends, their wives and children, and their wealth and busi-nesses, or to abandon jih˜d for the cause of Allah. Allah  said, {Say, ﬁIf your fathers, your sons, your broth-ers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwell-ings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jih˜d in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the de˚antly disobedient peopleﬂ} [At-Tawbah: 24]. As such, Syed Riz-wan Farook and his wife chose Allah and the Hereafter over the Duny˜, just as the Sah˜bah did so before them.For those who wonder how anyone could possibly leave their children be-hind in order to ˚ght and be killed for the sake of Allah, we remind them of Allah™s promise to care for those left behind by the believers. Allah  said, {Indeed, those who have said, ﬁOur Lord is Allahﬂ and then remained on a right course Œ the angels will descend upon them, saying, ﬁDo not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Jannah, which you were promised. We [angels] were your allies in the worldly life and are so in the Hereaf-terﬂ} [Fussilat: 30-31]. Im˜m Muj˜hid, the famous mufassir of the T˜bi™˙n, said that the meaning of {Do not fear and do not grieve} is, ﬁDo not fear that which you are heading to of the a˛airs of the Hereafter, and do not grieve over what you™ve left behind of your Duny˜, including family and children, for we will look after all of that for youﬂ [At-Tabar˙].ˇus, the believers who do trade with Allah will never lose, rather, they only stand to pro˚t. {O you who have be-lieved, shall I guide you to a transac-tion that will save you from a painful punishment?

He will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gar-dens beneath which rivers ˘ow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of per-petual residence. ˇat is the great at-tainment} [As-Sa˛: 10-12].May Allah accept the sacri˚ces of our noble brother Syed Rizwan Farook and his blessed wife, accept them among the shuhad˜™, and use their deeds as a means to awaken more Muslims in America, Europe, and Australia.Syed Rizwan Farook after attaining shah˚dah (may Allah accept him)FOREWORDSyed and his wife did not hold back from ful˛lling their obligation de-spite having a daughter to care for5667On the 21st of Rab˙™ al-Awwal, the t˜ghˆt ra™ˆd, with the ap-proval of their judges and the support of their scholastic stooges, executed dozens of great men whose only ﬁof-fenseﬂ was preaching tawh˙d and wag-ing jih˜d in the path of Allah.

In the severest terms, they have advised the youth to reject the true meaning of jih˜d and to replace it with national pride. ˇe ﬁhukm of Allahﬂ to them is whatever the Saudi governmental min-istries have deemed acceptable. ˇere-fore, it must be understood that these scholars are not simply silent bystand-ers in the background.Rather, the palace scholars of the Sau-di regime Œ from their ﬁGrand Muf-t˙ﬂ ‚Abdul-‚Ahaykh to the minions who spread deceitful pro-t˜ghˆt propaganda atop the pulpits of their ﬁkingdomﬂ Œ are at the forefront of this e˛ort to dissuade Muslims from jih˜d and from upholding the Shar˙™ah, averting them from the path of Allah. Hiding behind claims of be-ing ﬁSunn˙,ﬂ ﬁHanbal˙,ﬂ ﬁSalaf˙,ﬂ and especially descendants and students of Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b, they are truly nothing more than slaves of t˜ghˆt, waging war against the mu-j˜hid˙n in order to maintain the status quo. It was Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b who mentioned among the ten greatest nulli˚ers of Islam, ﬁEighth: Backing the mushrik˙n and aiding them against the Muslims. ˇe evidence is His  saying, {And whoever allies with them of you, then indeed he is of them. Ver-ily Allah does not guide the tyrannical people}ﬂ [Ar-Ras˜™il ash-Shakhsiyyah].When asked about the clear disparity between the Qur™˜n-backed creed of Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b and the Saudi regime™s constant coalition with crusaders against Muslims, pal-ace scholar H˜tim al-‚Awn˙ criticized Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b and considered this one of the reasons for a required revision of the texts written by the his-toric scholars of Najd.In their ﬁjusti˚cationﬂ of murdering muj˜hid˙n, the Saudis stated that the plans of some of these brothers were ﬁto damage the nation™s economy and harm the Kingdom™s status [and] its relations and interests with brotherly and friendly countries,ﬂ speci˚cally mentioning ﬁby storming the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah.ﬂ Such attacks on the regime™s brothers-in-kufr were The martyred shaykh, Ab˝ Jandal al-Azd˙ (may Allah accept him)The martyred shaykh, Hamd al-Hu-mayd˙ (may Allah accept him)8labeled by Sa™d ash-Shathr˙ Œ a consul-tant to the Saudi ﬁroyalﬂ council Œ as ﬁcausing mischief in the land.ﬂ Similar deceptions were delivered by his col-league ‚Abdull˜h al-Mutlaq and ‚™id al-Qarn˙, while Saudi poster boy Mu-hammad al-‚Ar˙f˙ hailed the ruling ju-diciary.Salm˜n al-‚Awdah called the executions a warning to Muslim youth against turning to what he calls ﬁextremismﬂ (i.e. jih˜d in the path of Allah) and the stooge ‚dil al-Kalb˜n˙ advised that people be wary of anyone who is angry with the executions, stating that such people are accomplices-in-crime to the condemned.No less support was given by ‚Abdull˜h haykh, Salm˜n an-Nashw˜n, ‚Abdur-Rahm˜n as-Sudays, Salih al-Magh˜mis˙, Sulaym˜n al-M˜jid, Muhammad as-Sa™˙d˙, ‚Iwad al-Qa-rn˙, Sa™˙d Ibn Mus˚r al-Qaht˜n˙, Yˆ-suf al-Muhawwis, and ‚Abdul-‚Az˙z al-Fawz˜n.And on this occasion, adh-Dhaw˜hir˙ came out and criticized the apostate Saudi regime but made no mention of the evil scholars backing them; rather, he merely advised the ﬁscholarsﬂ of the Arabian Peninsula to speak out against the government. Reiterating the dis-tinct di˛erence between his Irj˜™ poli-cies and the concept of wal˜™ and bar˜™, he did not advise the Muslims to wage war against the Saudi regime. Rather, he directed those who intend to seek revenge for the scholars to instead at-tack the Jewish and crusader masters a™ˆd. ˇe so-called ﬁwise man of the Ummahﬂ considered this the best response to the regime, wildly claim-ing it would push the crusaders to stop backing the Saudi state, a state that has done its utmost to serve the crusaders! ˇe jih˜d claimants don™t seem to real-ize that the only response to the shed-ding of Muslim blood is massacring the apostate murderers and all those who aid them Œ especially their loyal ﬁscholars.ﬂWhen then will the Muslims of the Arabian Peninsula wake up and act out against the apostasy of these palace scholars? Indeed, these ﬁscholarsﬂ have broken their oaths with Allah and with the Muslims, just as they have target-ed the religion with their lies and in-stigation against the people of jih˜d and piety. As Allah  said, {And if they break their oaths after their cov-enant and defame your religion, then ˚ght the im˜ms of kufr! Indeed, they shall have no oaths [of safety], that they might stop} [At-Tawbah: 12], so they shall have no pact nor safety and must be fought. Indeed, they are the present-day Abˆ Jahl Ibn Hish˜m, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf, and ‚Utbah Ibn Rab˙™ah, putting j˜hil˙ ﬁnational inter-estﬂ in front of the establishment of Islam.ˇese apostate palace scholars were de-scribed by the Prophet  as ﬁcallers to the gates of Jahannamﬂ and that ﬁthey are of our skin and speak our lan-guage.ﬂ When asked what should be done in case one witnesses such evil, he ordered, ﬁStick with the Jam˜™ah of the Muslims and their leaderﬂ [Re-ported by al-Bukh˜r˙ and Muslim from Hudhayfah]. Allah™s Messenger  also said, ﬁWhoever comes to you wanting to break your strength or divide your unity while your matter is altogeth-er under a single man, then kill himﬂ [Reported by Muslim from ‚Arfajah].ˇis is the punishment for one who merely attempts to divide the Mus-lim Jam˜™ah Œ the Khil˜fah Œ through propaganda and arms.

However, the reason to kill them now is even greater, as Allah  said, {So whoever aggresses against you, then aggress against him the like of which he aggressed against you} [Al-Baqarah: 194].May Allah  bless all the ﬁloneﬂ knights of the Khil˜fah in the Arabian Peninsula and grant them success in their deeds and purity in their hearts. KILL THE IM˜MS OF KUFR910FROM THE PAGES OF HISTORYIn short, the Safaw˜ State was a political cult of the Ith-n˚-˛Ashriyyah (Twelver) R˚˝dah, whose state was founded by Ism˚˙˜l Ibn Haydar in 906AH and oˆcially fell in 1148AH. In addition to their atrocious revival of Rafd (the religion of the R˚˝dah), they laid great emphasis on the Persian language (Farsi) and culture. Today˙s R˚˝dah are undoubtedly a contin-uation of this cult as they practice the same Rafd, implement the same policies towards Ahlus-Sunnah, and propagate the same Persianism.Named aˇer Ish˚q al-Ardab˜l˜ (died 735AH), who was of Turkmen or Kurdish origin and famous as ˘Saf˜ ad-D˜n,he Safawiyyah is a group that started as a supposedly ˘Sha˝˙˜ tar˜qah (S˜ order), which transformed into a militant R˚˝d˜ movement to become a tyrannical state that subdued Persia with ambitions to wipe out all traces of the Sunnah and its people.r ˝rst ˘sh˚h(Persian king) came to power in 906AH. He was Ism˚˙˜l Ibn Haydar, a direct descendant of Saf˜ ad-D˜n, and was marked by both severe deviance and brutality. Ash-Shawk˚n˜ said of him, ˘His following grew until he attacked and vanquished the sultan of Shirvan, whom his army cap-tured. He then ordered them to cook him in a cauldron and 1011eat himadr at-T˚li˙]. It is not surprising then to hear that when Ism˚˙˜l defeated the emir of Merv, he dismembered him Œ dispatching his limbs across Persia Œ and covered his skull with gold and gems to use it as a chalice at social events.Ism˚˙˜l˙s claim was that he received instructions from the awaited ˘Mahd˜,becoming ˘Allah˙s representative on earth to usher in a new state and sponsor the 12 im˚ms considered ˘infallibleby the R˚˝dah. Due to his S˜ background, he claimed to receive ˘ilh˚m ghayb˜,f ˘gnostic inspi-ration,resulting in his followers ascribing a divine status to him, even considering him ˘Allah˙s spirit incarnatee seek refuge with Allah from such blatant kufWith the full support of the Qizilb˚sh1 R˚˝d˜ militia, Ism˚˙˜l killed scores of Muslims, especially targeting any scholars teaching the Sunnah. He massacred thousands upon thou-sands and burned all the books of Ahlus-Sunnah, not even sparing their copies of the Qur˙˚n. Originally hosting an overwhelming Sunni-majority population, Persia, eastern Iraq, and Khur˚s˚n were once bustling with knowledge con-veyed by the likes of linguists S˜bawayh and al-Azhar˜; had˜th masters al-Bukh˚r˜ and Muslim; mufassir˜n at-Tabar˜ and al-Baghaw˜; and fuqah˚˙ al-Marwaz˜ and Ibnul-Mundhir.

It was al-Karak˜ who issued the fat˚w˚ allowing Ithn˚-˛Ashr˜ R˚˝dah to use military force to establish their rule, thus ˘substantiating Ism˚˙˜l˙s claims and justifying all of his abuses. Many Sunnis leˇ Persia, but those who stayed were persecuted, having to decide to either apostatize or face death. Regarding this pro-cess and his cruelty to Ahlus-Sunnah, Ism˚˙˜l said, ˘s mat-ter concerns me not, as Allah and the infallible im˚ms are with me, so I fear no one.

Tomé Pires, a crusader and Portuguese ambassador to China, who traveled through Persia during 916 and 917AH, witnessed this, saying, ˘He [Ism˚˙˜l] renovates our churches yet destroys the mas˚jid of Muslims who follow the Sunnah [Summa Oriental].In imitation of Ibn Buwayh, a R˚˝d˜ leader of the fourth cen-tury, Ism˚˙˜l revived public observance of al-Husayn˙s death, the rituals of which were described by Ibn Kath˜r, who said, ˘Orders were given [by Ibn Buwayh] for the markets to close, for women to wear hair-woven sackcloths, and to go out with their faces and hair uncovered, as they slapped their faces and wailed for al-Husayn Ibn ˛Al˜ Ibn Ab˜ T˚lib.

But due to the Portuguese enlisting the aid of ˘Sunnipuppets instead of R˚˝d˜ ones, Ism˚˙il˙s great grandson ˛Abb˚s broke ofaw˜ relations with those cru-saders Œ only to engage British crusaders in another alliance sparked by continued correspondence with European rulers from the era of his grandfather, Tahm˚sp Ibn Ism˚˙˜l.It was ˛Abb˚s who invited the crusaders Anthony and Robert Shirley, under the command of the Earl of Essex, to ˘mod-ernizehe Safaw˜ army in order to assist their cross-worship-ing allies further. Even towards the end of the R˚˝d˜ dynasty, in 1119AH, the Safaw˜ Husayn sought naval support from France˙s Louis XIV to take control over parts of the Arabian Gulf.y used such alliances, as well as craˇy politics with their neighbors, to further in˝ltrate lands in which Sunnis resided. Making agreements with the grave-worshipping Ottomans in 962AH, the R˚˝d˜ Safawiyyah were given permission to enter the Arabian Peninsula Œ like Salhas permitted for them today Œ to perform Hajj in Makkah, even though Allah said, {O you who believndeed the mushrik˜n are impure, so do not let them approach al-Masjid al-Har˚m aˇer this year of theirs} [At-Tawbah: 28].ugh their uence spread throughout the lands they con-quered, and though their lastinects are felt even today, the Safaw˜ ˘shahslived and died in disgrace. Ism˚˙˜l, aˇer a crushing defeat damaged his alleged ˘divinemage, withdrew to his palace, where he spent his ˝nal days in a drunken daze and died in 930AH, just 38 years old. Tahm˚sp Ibn Ism˚˙˜l died of poisoning in 984AH. Ism˚˙˜l Ibn Tahm˚sp had his brothers killed and blinded in order to secure his place on the throne, but aˇer only one year in power he was accused of not being R˚˝d˜ enough, poisoned to death, and thus overthrown by his mostly-blind brother Muhammad Khud˚bandah. Serv-ing as ˘sh˚hor 10 years, Khud˚bandah˙s reign ended when he was imprisoned by his own son, ˛Abb˚s, who assumed his father˙s position. Both a drunkard and a sodomite, he killed his heir Muhammad B˚qir, blinded two of his other sons, and then died in 1038AH.

Due to the importance of declaring the truth concerning those who compromise on the fundamental aspects of the religion and use ˝imsy arguments to justify waging war alongside the apostates and their crusader masters against the Muslims, the Islamic State recently issued a clari˙cation on its position concerning the factions that are waging war against it, stating:ﬁRecently, some questions have reached us about the o˝cial position of the Islamic State on the alliance of factions ˚ght-ing against the Islamic State in the northern countryside of Halab and other areas, particularly the factions that raise Is-lamic banners and slogans and ascribe themselves to jih˜d.ﬂﬁWe clarify to all that the Islamic State™s position is clear concerning the ruling on these factions, and it is that they are groups that have apostatized from the religion of Allah and have committed numerous deeds that have nulli˚ed the fundamentals of the religion. From amongst these deeds is that they ˚ght a state that rules by the Shar˙™ah of Allah while these factions are in one trench and one coalition with other factions that have resisted the implementation of the Shari™ah and declared their e˛orts to build a ‚democratic, civil, pluralistic™ state that removes the law of Allah from the lands of the Islamic State and replaces it with j˜hil˙ laws. All this is done with support and direct air cover from the American-led crusader coalition that only strives to destroy the mission of the Khil˜fah.ﬂﬁ{And it has already been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and ridi-culed, then do not sit with them until they enter into an-other conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them. Indeed, Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in Hell all together} [An-Nisa™: 140].ﬂﬁˇis is Allah™s ruling on one who sits with the ku˛˜r and does not separate from them or denounce them as they commit kufr and mock Allah™s verses. So how is it then with one who ˚ghts alongside them and backs and supports them against the Muslims who rule Allah™s earth with what MILITARY REPORTSAllah has revealed. ˇis is a clear-cut ruling in which we have no doubt, and it is built on clear, manifest realities that are not a˛ected by either corrupt interpretations or claims contradicted by reality.ﬂﬁWe ask Allah to repel the plot of the ku˛˜r, scatter their union, divide their assembly, and support the Islamic State against them.ﬂ˛e above statement, along with the operations conducted by the soldiers of the Khil˜fah against the factions of apostasy in all their colors, make it clear that the Islamic State does not diˆerentiate between those murtadd˚n who shamelessly ally with the disbelievers against the Muslims due to their openly secularist disposition, and those murtadd˚n who do so using false pretexts while taking desperate and futile measures to try and maintain an ﬁIslamicﬂ image.

At a young age, the honorable brother traveled with his family to Lon-don. ˇis would become a place he grew to hate along with its k˜˚r people, whose customs were far-removed from the praiseworthy values he was much accustomed to. It was through the mercy and blessings of Allah that Abˆ Muh˜rib attained the gift of a sound ‚aq˙dah and correct manhaj despite residing in one of the centers of kufr and despite the increased presence of deviants calling to the gates of Jahannam.Around the time of the blessed raids that rocked London and its transport system in ﬁ2005,ﬂ and while the jih˜d in Iraq was at its peak, with the announcement of the Islamic State of Iraq being made the following year, Abˆ Muh˜rib began to embark upon the path of hijrah and jih˜d. He would busy his days with jih˜d-related work together with his brothers in creed, including Bil˜l al-Bar-j˜w˙ and Muhammad Saqr (may Allah accept them), both of whom would later be killed in separate drone strikes in Somalia early in 1433AH.1 None of this went unnoticed by MI5 (British intelli-gence), which started vigorously targeting Abˆ Muh˜rib and those with him. ˇus began the campaign of bugging devices, routine surveillance, house raids, arrests, and no-˘y lists, which also came to include the prevention of any form of overseas travel.Despite the e˛orts of MI5, Abˆ Muh˜rib never ceased in his strug-gle to make hijrah for the sake of Allah. On his last attempt to leave the UK for his homeland of Kuwait, Abˆ Muh˜rib was stopped at the airport and kept for questioning by MI5, the result of which was their refusal to allow him to travel. During the interrogation, Abˆ Muh˜rib would present himself as unintelligent, as was his method when dealing with intelligence agencies. ˇe Prophet  said, ﬁWar is deceptionﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˙ and Muslim].One particular agent said to him, ﬁYou™re not going anywhere. We are going to be on you like a shadow.ﬂ ˇe joke would eventually be on him, for it was just a matter of days before Allah opened for Abˆ Muh˜rib the opportunity to make hijrah to Sh˜m.

Depending upon Allah alone for success, Abˆ Muh˜rib with his companion embarked on a long and strenuous journey that totaled approximately two months and involved trekking the mountain ranges of Europe and its marshy farmlands, sneaking across borders, and being detained by the authorities of various nations on at least two occasions. ˇe journey required a great amount of patience and a high degree of security precautions, two things for which Abˆ Muh˜rib was well known.2ˇrough their persistence and perseverance, Allah grant-ed them safe deliverance into Sh˜m in the latter part of ﬁ2012.ﬂ Upon arrival, Abˆ Muh˜rib wasted no time and immediately placed his hand with the Jam˜™ah, joining the Islamic State while it was operating under the name ﬁJabhat an-Nusrah,ﬂ prior to al-Jawl˜n˙™s treachery. He was not de-ceived by the presence of hundreds of groups, or their nu-merous ˘ags bearing their hypocritical logos and names. It would be through this very manner of foresight and deci-siveness that Allah would grant Abˆ Muh˜rib steadfastness throughout the many trials which the Islamic State would encounter, including al-Jawl˜n˙™s betrayal and nulli˚cation of his bay™ah to Am˙rul-Mu™min˙n Abu Bakr al-Baghd˜d˙ (ha˚dhahull˜h). Abˆ Muh˜rib was among the very ˚rst to declare his disavowal of al-Jawl˜n˙ and would say regarding him, ﬁHe™s just going to be another Shaykh Shar˙f,ﬂ refer-ring to former head of the Islamic Courts Union of Somalia Œ Sharif Sheikh Ahmed Œ who committed blatant apostasy by entering into the parliaments of shirk and supporting the United States and African crusader nations in the war against Islam and the Muslims.It was Abˆ Muh˜rib™s sincerity, ambition, and enthusiasm to work and tire himself for Allah™s sake that granted him prominence, as he grew to be loved and respected by many. He participated in the conquest of the Taftan˜z airbase near Idlib and the 17th Division base near ar-Raqqah. He also partook in the operation in Salq˙n near Idlib Œ where Abˆ Mu™˜wiyah al-Misr˙3 was martyred Œ as well as in many oth-er battlefronts. He also participated in the ˚ghting against the sahw˜t of Sh˜m and was injured within the ˚rst week of the Sahwah, sustaining a gunshot wound to his back during the battle to retake Hurayt˜n.His harshness towards the ku˛ar was manifested through deeds that enraged all the nations, religions, and factions of kufr, the entire world bearing witness to this. {ˇat is be-2   Editor™s Note: Perhaps we release the story of his long hijrah in a future issue. 3   To read about Abˆ Mu™˜wiyah al-Misr˙ and his best friend Abˆ Qud˜mah al-Misr˙ (may Allah accept them both), see D˜biq, issue 7, ﬁAmong the Believers are Men,ﬂ pages 46-49. cause people ary thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah, nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbeliev anything except that is registered for them as a righteous deed} [At-Tawbah: 120].A side of Abˆ Muh˜rib that wasn™t witnessed except by those who knew him was his mercy, kindness, and gener-osity towards the believers, his protective jealousy for Islam and its people, and his a˛ection towards the orphans. Of the deeds that attest to his kindness and generosity is that after receiving a sabiyyah (concubine) as a gift he did not hesitate to give her away Œ likewise as a gift Œ to an unmar-ried injured brother. And from the incidents that attest to his protective jealousy for Islam and its people is that after engaging in a debate with a Madkhal˙ (a pro-Saudi ﬁSalaf˙ﬂ) in one of the ﬁmas˜jidﬂ in the lands of kufr, the Madkhal˙ remarked regarding the abuses of the spiteful Jews against our sisters in Palestine that the women ﬁdeserved it.ﬂ Abˆ Muh˜rib had to be restrained from hitting this Madkhal˙ by other worshippers at the ﬁmasjid.ﬂ A brother who witnessed the incident recalled, ﬁAbˆ Muh˜rib began to weep loudly. I watched him in his prayer weeping in sujˆd as if he had lost a loved one.ﬂAnd amongst the deeds that attest to his a˛ection towards the orphans is that following the martyrdom of Bil˜l al-Bar-j˜w˙, Abˆ Muh˜rib would frequently visit his orphaned son, taking him to the mas˜jid and entertaining him with trips out to the park and the zoo. He would also teach Qur™˜n to other sons of shuhad˜™. {Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the ku˛˜r, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. ˇeir mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. ˇat is their description in the Tawr˜h. And their descrip-tion in the Inj˙l is as a plant which produces its o˛shoots and strengthens them so they grow ˚rm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers Œ so that Allah may en-rage by them the ku˛˜r. Allah has promised those who be-lieve and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward} [Al-Fath: 29].On ˇursday, the 29th of Muharram, 1437, Abˆ Muh˜rib ˚nally achieved shah˜dah for the cause of Allah, which he had sought for so long, as the car he was in was targeted in a strike by an unmanned drone in the city of ar-Raqqah, de-stroying the car and killing him instantly. May Allah accept our brother among the shuhad˜™, envelop him with His mercy, and enter him into the highest levels of al-Firdaws.24In the name of Allah, the Gracious the Merciful. May bless-ings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family, his companions, and his followers. To proceed: ˇis is some advice for the noble widows of the blessed shu-had˜™ in the mighty lands of the Khil˜fah pertaining to the rulings of ‚iddah, especially those of ihd˜d (mourning their husbands). Some common mistakes are also brie˘y men-tioned. May Allah bless the patient sisters through their grief. And all success is from Allah alone.Ihd˜d Œ according to the Shar˙™ah Œ is for the widow to stop adorning herself with jewelry, perfume, decorative clothing, and anything else meant to beautify oneself. ˇis is an ob-ligation during the ‚iddah for all women whose husbands have passed away. ˇe Messenger of Allah  said, ﬁˇe woman is not to mourn more than three days, except for her husband, for whom she shall mourn for four months and ten days. She should not wear any colorful clothing except for cloth used to block menstrual blood. Nor should she wear kohl or use any perfume, except at the end of her menses when she bathes therefrom, with only a dab of qust or adhf˜rﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˙ and Muslim from Umm ‚Atiyyah].Ibn Hajar commented, ﬁWhat is meant by ‚qust or adhf˜r™ is as an-Nawaw˙ explained, to pass these two types of per-fume over the area where there was blood in order to mask the smell, and not for the purpose of perfuming oneselfﬂ [Fath al-B˜r˙].Zaynab Bint Ab˙ Salamah narrated that she entered upon Umm Hab˙bah , the wife of the Prophet  at the time TO OUR SISTERSher father Abˆ Sufy˜n  died. She called for some yellow-ish perfume Œ khalˆq (a sa˛ron mixture) or otherwise Œ and anointed a young girl with it. She then touched the sides of her own face with it and said, ﬁBy Allah, I have no need for perfume, except that I heard the Messenger of Allah  say, ‚It is not allowed for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for the deceased more than three nights, except for a husband for four months and ten days™ﬂ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˙ and Muslim].As for the woman who is pregnant when her husband dies, then her ‚iddah is until she gives birth, whether the baby is born alive or dead, whether it completes its term or arrives premature, whether it is a whole baby or a de˚cient fetus. Allah  said, {And for those who are pregnant, their term is until they give birth} [At-Tal˜q: 4]. Ibn ‚Abb˜s  said commenting on the verse {And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind Œ they, [the wives, shall] wait four months and ten days} [Al-Baqarah: 234], ﬁˇis is the ‚iddah of one whose husband passed away, except if she is pregnant. ˇen her ‚iddah is until she gives birthﬂ [Tafs˙r Ibn Ab˙ H˜tim]. ˇere is no khil˜f on this, as Ibnul-Qayyim  stated, ﬁAs for the pregnant woman, then there is agreement amongst the scholars that when her pregnancy ends the obligation of ihd˜d also ends for her and she can then get married and beautify, perfume, and adorn herself as she likes for her husbandﬂ [Z˜d al-Ma™˜d].During her ‚iddah, it is har˜m for the mourning widow to use kohl and dyes, just as it is har˜m for her to wear jewelry, whether of gold or silver or otherwise. Allah™s Messenger  said, ﬁˇe woman whose husband passed away is not to wear sa˛ron-dyed clothing, ruddled garments, or jewelry, 25nor is she to dye her hair or apply kohlﬂ [Reported by Abˆ D˜wˆd and an-Nas˜™˙ from Umm Salamah].A woman came to the Messenger of Allah  and said, ﬁO Messenger of Allah, my daughter™s husband passed away and she complains of pain in her eye. Should I apply kohl to her?ﬂ ˇe Messenger of Allah  said, ﬁNo,ﬂ two or three times [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˙ and Muslim from Umm Salamah].Ibn ‚Abb˜s  said, ﬁHe would forbid the one whose hus-band passed away from using perfume and adornmentﬂ [Musannaf Ibn Ab˙ Shaybah].As for the use of dyes in clothing, then those ﬁthat are not intended for adornment Œ like the color black or what is dyed to make something look less appealing or to cover up blemishes Œ are not prohibitedﬂ [Z˜d al-Ma™˜d Œ Ib-nul-Qayyim]. Ibnul-Mundhir  (died 319AH) also said that both M˜lik and ash-Sh˜˚™˙ considered it permissible for the mourning widow to wear black ﬁbecause it is not an adornment and it is the clothing of griefﬂ [Naylul-Awt˜r Œ Ash-Shawk˜n˙]. And Allah knows best.Additionally, the mourning widow must complete her ‚iddah in the house in which she lived when her husband died, whether it is his property or a rental. ˇe sister of Abˆ Sa™˙d al-Khudr˙  went to the Messenger of Allah  to ask him for permission to return to her family from Ban˙ Khudrah, explaining that her husband went out searching for some runaway slaves, but was killed by them when he found them. She said, ﬁI asked Allah™s Messenger  that I return to my family, as my husband left me no home and no spending money.ﬂ ˇe Messenger of Allah  approved, but when she left, he called for her and said, ﬁWhat did you ask?ﬂ She repeated the story about her husband to him. He said, ﬁStay in your house in which you received the news of your husband™s death until the appointed time is reached.ﬂ She said, ﬁSo I counted my ‚iddah therein for four months and ten days.ﬂ She continued, ﬁˇen when ‚Uthm˜n asked me about that [during his khil˜fah], I informed him of the matter. So he adhered to it and ruled accordinglyﬂ [Report-ed in the four Sunan and declared sah˙h by at-Tirmidh˙, Ibn Hibb˜n, and al-H˜kim].At-Tirmidh˙  said, ﬁˇis had˙th is hasan sah˙h and most of the scholars from the Sah˜bah and others acted thereon. ˇey did not allow the woman in her ‚iddah to move from her husband™s house until her ‚iddah ended. ˇis is the opin-ion of Sufy˜n ath-ˇawr˙, ash-Sh˜˚™˙, Ahmad, and Ish˜q.ﬂSo this had˙th proves that the mourning widow must stay in the home in which she resided with her husband. ˇis is the opinion of most scholars. ‚Uthm˜n Ibn ‚A˛˜n Œ the Rightly-Guided Khal˙fah Œ also ruled according to this in the presence of the Muh˜jir˙n and the Ans˜r. It was also the opinion of the second Rightly-Guided Khal˙fah ‚Umar and his son, as well as Ibn Mas™ˆd and others from the Sah˜bah, may Allah be pleased with all of them.As such, it is har˜m for the mourning widow to move from her home to another except with a lawful excuse, as was explained by Ibn Qud˜mah, who said, ﬁIf she fears demo-lition of the house, drowning therein, an approaching en-emy, or something along these lines, or the owner of the house wishes to move her elsewhere, such as him lending the house then changing his mind, or its lease has ended, or he wrongfully expels her from the house or refuses to renew the lease, or he demands more than its going price, or she cannot a˛ord it except from her own wealth, then she is allowed to move, as such situations are excusable and she is not required to pay for housing [from her own wealth], but her only obligation is that of residing there, not in obtain-ing the place itself. If she is unable to reside there [for rea-sons mentioned earlier], the obligation fallsﬂ [Al-Mughn˙].And while the mourning widow spends her ‚iddah residing at her husband™s home, if she has any needs to attend to, then she can do so during the day, as night is a time that causes suspicions to arise. But, if she can ˚nd someone to run errands and take care of other needs for her, then the best place for her is her home. When she does go out for a need, she has to be back by maghrib (sunset). Lastly, she can™t sleep anywhere except at her home.Ibn ‚Umar  said, ﬁIt is not right that she should spend a single night, during the ‚iddah of either death or divorce, except in her homeﬂ [Musannaf ‚Abdir-Razz˜q].And while Ibn ‚Umar™s daughter  was in her ‚iddah af-ter the passing away of her husband, she would visit her family during the day and speak with them; but as night fell, he would order her to return to her house [Musannaf ‚Abdir-Razz˜q].Likewise, some women from Hamd˜n who were informed of their husbands passing away told Ibn Mas™ˆd , ﬁWe are feeling very lonely.ﬂ So he said to them, ﬁGather with one another during the day, then each woman should return to her home at nightﬂ [Musannaf ‚Abdir-Razz˜q]. Of course, such gatherings should not become the norm, in adherence to the ˜yah, {And abide in your houses} [Al-Ahz˜b: 33]. ˇese gatherings should also be free of gossip, backbiting, and other sins. And the mourning widow must observe the rulings of ihd˜d therein. ˇese occasional gatherings ought to serve a purpose such as worship, learning the religion, or keeping family ties.ˇus, the mourning widow should remember that the Muslim˜t Œ widows or not Œ do not leave their homes ex-26cept occasionally and only for good reasons. Allah  said to the Muslim˜t as a whole, {And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as in the former times of j˜hili-yyah} [Al-Ahz˜b: 33]. Ibn Kath˙r said, ﬁHis saying, {And abide in your houses}, i.e. remain in your homes and do not leave except for a reason.ﬂ ˇis ˜yah is regarding Muslim˜t in general. How much more so does the ˜yah apply to the mourning widow?And the various scholars of the madh˜hib have addressed this topic. Ibn ‚Abdil-Barr al-M˜lik˙, for example, said, ﬁIt is upon the woman in ‚iddah whether due to the death of her husband or divorce to sleep at her home – It is okay if she leaves her home during the day for her errands – She should try to return home before the sun sets. It is not permissible for her to sleep except at her home. If she leaves during a night of her ‚iddah and sleeps elsewhere, she is sinful by her deedﬂ [Al-K˜f˙].An-Nawaw˙ ash-Sh˜˚™˙ said, ﬁIt is okay for the mourning wid-ow to go out to run errands during the day – But she must return to her home and sleep thereﬂ [Rawdat at-T˜lib˙n].Ibn Qud˜mah al-Hanbal˙ also said that the mourning wid-ow ﬁcan go out to run her errands during the dayﬂ but that ﬁshe cannot sleep anywhere but at her home. She cannot leave during the night except for necessity, because night is a time that raises suspicions of corruption, unlike the day, which is assumed to be a time for errands, markets, and buying what is neededﬂ [Al-Mughn˙].Another matter that many sisters face after their husbands pass away is marriage proposals during ‚iddah. It is unques-tionably har˜m for a man to directly propose to a woman during her ‚iddah, as Allah  said, {ˇere is no sin upon you in that which you insinuate or hide in your hearts con-cerning your wish to propose to [widowed] women. Allah knows that you will think of them. However do not meet them privately, but only utter a proper word. And do not directly propose until the prescribed term has expired. Know that Allah knows what is in your hearts, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing} [Al-Baqarah: 235].ˇe forbidden, direct proposal Œ as explained in the ˜th˜r of the Salaf Œ is that, for example, a man says to a widow during her ‚iddah, ﬁLet™s get married.ﬂ As for the permis-sible insinuation, it is that he alludes to his wish to marry her by, for example, having a sister mention him in front of the mourning widow, saying, ﬁSo-and-so is looking to marry a good woman like yourself. May Allah grant him a good wife.ﬂHere it is good to mention some common mistakes com-mitted by sisters during their terms of ‚iddah. First and fore-most is the error of leaving the house during night or for no good reason at all, which was touched upon above. Even if the woman is pregnant in her ˚rst month, she should surrender to the command of her Lord and have patience for the duration of her ‚iddah, no matter how long it may be, and she has to try to be content with her test and know that the reward is granted according to the trial™s di˝culty.Second is the error of attending weddings and wedding par-ties. Some mourning widows claim, ﬁI went to the wedding without wearing any adornment.ﬂ ˇe problem is that, oth-er than the principle being that she should try to stay in her house throughout the ‚iddah, she also has to maintain the persona of grief for her deceased husband. So how can a mourning widow go to a party in which joy and happiness are manifested to the utmost, even if she herself does not wear any adornment?!ˇird is that a mourning widow cannot make promises to marry a man who might have insinuated his wish to marry her after her ‚iddah. ˇis is wrong, as indicated in the verse mentioned before [Al-Baqarah: 235].Fourth is that some women are excessive in their adherence to ihd˜d, living their whole lives in mourning! One can only say to them that the best of creation  died and the Mothers of the Believers did not observe such a life of sor-row. Likewise, his companions passed away and it was never reported that any of their wives exaggerated the mourning for their husbands as is done today by some women who might even spend the rest of their lives at their homes with-out wearing any kind of adornment or using any type of perfume! ˇis even exceeds what the women of J˜hiliyyah did, as they would only go for just a single year without adornment!And the ˚nal point is for the brothers Œ in Islam Œ of the mourning widows. Allah  said, {O you who believe! Avoid too much suspicion [of others]. Indeed, some suspicion is sinful. And do not spy or backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the ˘esh of his dead brother? You detest that! And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful} [Al-Hujur˜t: 12]. ˇus, the brother should not jump to bad conclusions if he sees a mourning widow outside her home during the day, and thereafter backbite her or allow other women to gossip about her. Rather, he should assume the best and give her the bene˚t of the doubt. And Allah knows best.May Allah give all mourning widows the strength to com-plete their ‚iddah with faith and submission to His will. And may blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and all of his companions.TO OUR SISTERS2728he has to ˚ght alone, because He has guaranteed for him support.™ Ibn ‚Atiyyah said, ‚ˇis is the apparent mean-ing of the wording, but nothing has been narrated about ˚ghting being obligatory upon him alone at any point in time without it also being obligatory on the Ummah. So the meaning Œ and Allah knows best Œ is that the wording addresses him, while it is a lesson for everyone individ-ually; that is, the statement to you, O Muhammad, and {So ˚ght in the cause of Allah; you are not held respon-sible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to ˚ght] that perhaps Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. And Allah is greater in might and stronger in punishment} [An-Nis˜™: 84].Al-Qurtub˙ states in his tafs˙r of this ˜yah, ﬁAz-Zajj˜j said, ‚Allah  ordered His Messenger  to wage jih˜d, even if DO THEY NOT THEN REFLECT ON THE QUR˚˜N2829every individual from your Ummah is, {So ˚ght in the cause of Allah; you are not held responsible except for yourself}.™ And for this reason, it is incumbent on every believer to wage jih˜d, even if he has to do so alone. And in that regard is the statement of the Prophet , ‚By Al-lah, I will surely ˚ght them even if I™m alone™ [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˙ from al-Miswar and Marw˜n], and also the statement of Abˆ Bakr when the apostasy occurred, ‚And if my right hand were to oppose me, I would wage jih˜d against it with my left hand.™™ﬂˇis statement of al-Qurtub˙, along with those of other mufassir˙n, highlights the magnitude of what the believers have been burdened with. ˇe matter of believing in Al-lah and then striving to raise high His kalimah Œ l˜ il˜ha illall˜h Œ is so signi˚cant that if one had no choice but to march forth and ˚ght by himself to achieve this, he would have to do so. As such, Allah  reminds His Messenger  and the believers that each individual is only responsible for himself. He should not look around and base his deci-sion to make hijrah and wage jih˜d for the cause of Allah on what other people are doing. Nor should he hesitate to strike the enemies of Allah  if it™s within his means to do so, even if he were alone.On the statement of Allah, {You are not held responsible except for yourself}, Ibn Kath˙r mentions a report from Ibn Ab˙ H˜tim that al-Bar˜™ Ibn ‚zib  was asked if a man who encountered a hundred of the enemy and fought them was considered to be from those about whom Allah said, {And do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction} [Al-Baqarah: 195]. He replied, ﬁAllah  said to His Prophet, {So ˚ght in the cause of Allah; you are not held responsible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to ˚ght]}.ﬂˇus, the believer should be prepared to ˚ght alone when necessary and to incite others to join him in jih˜d. He should not be discouraged by a lack of numbers and should understand that the rewards of a good deed are multiplied when one faces greater di˝culty in carrying them out, as is the case when one ˚nds no one to support him in ˚ghting the ku˛˜r, yet courageously marches for-ward and terrorizes the enemies of Allah nonetheless.In his tafs˙r of the aforementioned ˜yah, al-Qurtub˙ then explains the statement of Allah {ˇat perhaps Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve}, saying, ﬁAllah restrained the might of the mushrik˙n at Badr as-Sughr˜ (the Minor Badr) and they went back on what they promised the Prophet of war and ˚ghting1  – Allah 1   ˇe Minor Badr refers to an appointment for battle between the Prophet  and the mushrik˙n of Quraysh two years after the decisive battle of Badr. ˇe Prophet  and his companions camped at Badr for eight days waiting for the enemy to arrive. ˇe mushrik˙n halted their march towards Badr when they reached the area of Marr adh-Dhahr˜n, also su˝ced the believers at al-Hudaybiyah of what the mushrik˙n sought to carry out of treachery and opportun-ism. ˇus, the believers sensed their plot and headed out, capturing them as prisoners, and this occurred as the en-voys were going between them to negotiate a truce.2 ˇis is what is intended by His  statement, {And it is He who withheld their hands from you} [Al-Fath: 24] – And Allah cast terror into the hearts of the factions [during al-Khandaq] and they departed without any killing or ˚ghting, as He  said, {And Allah spared the believers from having to ˚ght}. Likewise, the Jews left their homes and their wealth [near al-Mad˙nah] without the Muslims battling them. So all this is might that Allah restrained frers, in addition to a large num-ber of Jews and Christians leaving o˛ war and entering into the jizyah agreement in humiliation and submissively. ˇus, Allah restrained their might from the believers.ﬂˇese words altogether carry a monumental lesson for the and decided to forego the battle and return to Makkah due to their fear.2   ˇis refers to an incident that took place when the Prophet  was encamped outside Makkah as the treaty of Hudaybiyah was being negotiated with Quraysh. ˇe more zealous youth of Quraysh saw that their leaders wanted a treaty with the Prophet , so they sought to devise a plan that would ruin the negotiations. ˇey decided to head out at night and stealthily move towards the Muslim encampment where they would take action and attempt to ignite a war. Around seventy or eighty of them went out and descended from Mount at-Tan™˙m, attempting to sneak towards the Muslim camp, but were all captured by Muhammad Ibn Maslamah, the commander of the Muslim guard. ˇe Prophet  later freed them all to ensure the successful negotiation of the treaty. In this regard, Allah  revealed the ˜yah, {And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within the area of Makkah after He caused you to overcome them} [Al-Fath: 24].{And Allah is greater in might and stron-ger in punishment} [An-Nis˚™: 84]30believers: No matter how powerful the ku˛˜r may seem, Allah is capable of restraining their might and keeping it frers, and He can do so in sever-al ways; by sowing discord within their ranks, or bring-ing about conditions that make it impossible for them to wage an all-out war against the believers,3 or by interven-ing when they attack with all their might and destroying them in a manner that could not have been imagined, for {None knows the armies of your Lord except Him} [Al-Muddaththir: 31].Likewise, no matter how weak the Ummah may appear, Allah is capable of granting victory to His pious slaves, for He  has control over all a˛airs. ˇe weakness of the Muslims militarily in comparison with their enemies can, therefore, never be an excuse not to wage jih˜d, because {Allah is predominant over His a˛air} [Yˆsuf: 21] and as such will support His slaves and grant them victory even over an enemy that is exponentially more powerful than they are. ˇe odds mean nothing, for {Indeed, the plot of Shayt˜n has ever been weak} [An-Nis˜™: 76], and {How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of Allah} [Al-Baqarah: 249]. So how much more guarantee do the believers need from Allah in order to understand that victory has been decreed for them and all they need to do is to march forth and seek it! ˇis was 3   An example of this today is the crusaders™ refusal to put boots on the ground in their war against the Khil˜fah. ˇus, Allah has restrained their might in that regard and allowed the Islamic State to continue to expand while the crusaders are busy vetting, bribing, and training apostates to do the ˚ghting for them, with their e˛orts largely proving fruitless. a lesson that Ban˙ Isr˜™˙l failed to grasp, for when Mˆs˜  ordered them to march forth and claim the land that Allah had decreed for them, they used the enemy™s over-whelming strength as an excuse to refrain from jih˜d for the cause of Allah. {ﬁO my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you and do not turn back and [thus] become losers.ﬂ ˇey said, ﬁO Mˆs˜, indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength, and indeed, we will never enter it until they leave it; but if they leave it, then we will enterﬂ} [Al-M˜™idah: 21-22]. ˇeir failure to place their trust in their Lord and wage jih˜d for His cause then led to their punishment, such that they were forbidden from entering the Holy Land and made to wander about for forty years. {Allah said, ﬁˇen indeed, it is forbidden to them for forty years in which they will wander through-out the land. So do not grieve over the de˚antly disobedi-ent peopleﬂ} [Al-M˜™idah: 26].ˇe Muslim must therefore be wary of ignoring Allah™s command to ˚ght for His cause, and even more wary of accepting the ˘imsy excuses put forth by the defeatist ﬁscholars,ﬂ whose claims that the Ummah is too weak to wage jih˜d are being proven false by the Islamic State day after day.May Allah return the Muslims to their religion and guide them back to the path of jih˜d.DO THEY NOT THEN REFLECT ON THE QUR˚˜N3132THE R˜FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA˚ TO THE DAJJ˜L3233˛e R˜˙dah and the Jewsˇe T˜bi™˙ ash-Sha™b˙  (died 104AH) said, ﬁI warn you against the followers of deviant desires. And the worst of them are the R˜˚dah, as they are the Jews of this Ummah. Some of them are Jews who fake Islam to spread their de-viance, just as Paul of the Jews faked Christianity to spread his deviance, hoping the Jews would become victorious. ˇe R˜˚dah hate Islam just as the Jews hate Christiani-ty. ˇey did not enter Islam longing for Allah or fearing Him, rather out of spite for the people of Islam and so as to in˘ict harm upon them. ˇeir prayers do no exceed their ears. Indeed, ‚Al˙  burned them alive and banished them to other lands. Amongst them was ‚Abdull˜h Ibn Saba™, a Jew from the Jews of Sanaa, who was banished to S˜b˜t.ﬂHe  also said, ﬁIndeed, the calamity of the R˜˚dah is the same as the calamity of the Jews. ˇe Jews say that only a person from the lineage of D˜wˆd is suited for kingship. ˇe R˜˚dah say that only a person from the lineage of ‚Al˙ is suited for im˜mah. ˇe Jews say that there is no jih˜d until the Messiah comes forth and a sword descends from the heavens. ˇe R˜˚dah say there is no jih˜d until the Mahd˙ comes forth and a caller calls out from the heavens saying, ‚Follow him.™ ˇe Jews distorted the Tawr˜h. ˇe R˜˚dah did the same, distorting the Qur™˜n. ˇe Jews are not truth-ful when they say sal˜m to the believers, rather they say, ‚May s˜m be upon you.™ And s˜m means death. ˇe R˜˚-dah are the same. ˇe Jews consider the wealth of all people to be hal˜l, as Allah described them in the Qur™˜n as say-ing, {ﬁˇere is no blame upon us concerning the illiterate mr˜n: 75]. ˇe R˜˚dah are the same, as they consider the wealth of all Muslims to be hal˜l. ˇe Jews consider the blood of all Muslims to be hal˜l. ˇe R˜˚dah are the same. ˇe Jews consider the cheating of people to be hal˜l. ˇe R˜˚dah are the same. ˇe Jews hate Jibr˙l and say he is their enemy from amongst the angels. ˇe R˜˚dah are the same, as some of them claim that Jibr˙l mistakenly descended with revelation upon Muhammad  and abandoned ‚Al˙ .ﬂ1ˇis is a reality of which there is no doubt. ˇe Jews and the R˜˚dah are two sides of the same coin. ˇe religion of Rafd (ﬁShiismﬂ) was nothing but a plot by a Jew Œ Ibn Saba™ Œ following the footsteps of his Jewish predecessor Paul, who had corrupted the pure religion of the Messiah , leaving the Christians upon the Pauline deviance and heresies of the cross, original sin, incarnation, atonement, the lordship, divine sonhood, and godhead of the Messiah, and antino-mianism (abandonment of the Law of Mˆs˜ ).1   ˇe various statements of ash-Sha™b˙ were reported by al-Khall˜l in ﬁAs-Sunnah,ﬂ al-L˜lik˜™˙ in ﬁSharh Usˆl al-I™tiq˜d,ﬂ Ibn Taymiyyah in ﬁMinh˜j as-Sunnah,ﬂ and others.Who Was Ibn Saba™?ˇe Jew Ibn Saba™, like Paul, hated Islam and desired to de-viate the Muslims and corrupt their religion by innovating deviant concepts including the godhood, lordship, and sec-ond coming of ‚Al˙ Ibn Ab˙ T˜lib . At the same time, he strived to create strife amongst the Muslim ranks, inciting against the Righteous Khal˙fah ‚Uthm˜n  until ‚Uthm˜n was killed. ˇe killing of ‚Uthm˜n led to the deaths of more Muslims and the eventual emergence of the Khaw˜rij, who assassinated ‚Al˙ , who Ibn Saba™ had once claimed was Allah!About him, Ibn Taymiyyah  said, ﬁˇe ˚rst to innovate Rafd was a heretical hypocrite named ‚Abdull˜h Ibn Saba™. He wanted thereby to corrupt the religion of the Muslims like Paul Œ the author of the letters read by the Christians Œ innovated for the Christians heresies by which he corrupt-ed their religion. Paul was a Jew who hypocritically faked Christianity with the intent to corrupt it. Ibn Saba™ was also a Jew intending the same. He strived to spread falsehood aiming to corrupt the religion, but was unable to do so. However, some discord and strife occurred amongst the Muslims, strife in which ‚Uthm˜n  was killed. ˇereafter the ˚tnah transpiredﬂ [Majmˆ™ al-Fat˜w˜].At-Tabar˙  said in his t˜r˙kh, ﬁIbn Saba™ adopted Islam during the khil˜fah of ‚Uthm˜n. He then toured the Mus-lims™ lands, trying to deviate them. He started with al-Hij˜z, then al-Basrah, then al-Kˆfah, then ash-Sh˜m. He did not succeed in launching his plot amongst the people of Sh˜m. ˇey eventually expelled him. He then went to Egypt and called its people. Amongst what he said to them was, ‚How strange ars˜ will return but deny that Muhammad will return, whereas Allah  said, {In-deed, He who imposed upon you the Qur™˜n will bring you back to a returning place} [Al-Qasas: 85].2 ˇerefore, 2   ˇe scholars of tafs˙r say that the verse was a promise to the Prophet  that he would once again return to Makkah after being forced out from it.The R˚˛dah of Iran dedicate a me-morial to dead Iranian Jews34Muhammad is more worthy of rs˜.™ Some people accepted his call and he thereby innovated for them the concept of the second coming. ˇey started talking about it. He then said to them, ‚ˇere were a thousand prophets and every prophet had an heir. ‚Al˙ was the heir of Muhammad.™ He then began to say, ‚Muhammad was the ˚nal prophet and ‚Al˙ was the ˚nal heir.™ He then began to say, ‚Who can be more tyrannical than a person who does not execute the bequest of Rasˆlull˜h , and thereafter pounced upon the heir of Rasˆlull˜h , taking authority of the Ummah!™ He then said, ‚‚Uthm˜n took the matter without right. ‚Al˙ is the heir of Rasˆlull˜h . So rise for this matter and provoke it. Begin by defaming your leaders. Manifest yourselves in commanding good and forbidding evil, so that you win over the people and then call them to this matter.™ He then sent out his callers and wrote to those who had been corrupted in the lands and who had written to him beforehand. ˇey would secretly call to the belief they held. ˇey displayed themselves in commanding good and forbidding evil, sending out letters to the various regions, letters defaming the leaders.ﬂIbn Saba™ died around 40AH, after spreading the seeds of Rafd and ˚tnah for generations to come. He is the founder of Rafd and considered the instigator of the Khaw˜rij. For this reason, the scholars who wrote about the various devi-ant sects mention him in their discussions on the Khaw˜rij in addition to those on the R˜˚dah. ˇe Khaw˜rij did not emerge except as a result of Ibn Saba™s plot against ‚Uthm˜n . Ibn Saba™s followers would later agree with the Khaw˜rij on a fundamental tenet of their heresy, that is, like the Khaw˜rij, they would pronounce takf˙r upon most of the Sah˜bah, all the common Muslims, and all the khulaf˜™.˛e Meaning of ﬁR˜˙dahﬂIbn Saba™s ˚tnah ultimately led to the forming of the sect known as the R˜˚dah, who would carry a modi˚ed form of his da™wah. ˇe sect, like all deviant sects, would evolve over time, innovating more and more heresies, kufr, and wickedness.As for the name ﬁR˜˚dah,ﬂ then it comes from the word ﬁrafadaﬂ meaning to reject. ˇey were named so when they came to Zayd Ibn ‚Al˙ Ibn al-Husayn Ibn ‚Al˙ Ibn Ab˙ T˜lib  (died 122AH) and asked him to declare bar˜™ah from Abˆ Bakr and ‚Umar  in exchange for their support. He refused to do so and instead said, ﬁMay Allah have mercy upon them both.ﬂ So they told him, ﬁWe then reject you.ﬂ Henceforth, they were called ﬁthe rejecters.ﬂ ˇe schol-ars also called them so because the R˜˚dah rejected the im˜mah of Abˆ Bakr, ‚Umar, and ‚Uthm˜n, because they rejected the Sah˜bah, because they rejected the Sunnah, and because they essentially rejected the Qur™˜n and the religion of Islam.As for the name ﬁSh˙™ah,ﬂ then it is from the root ﬁsh˜ya™aﬂ meaning to support, as the R˜˚dah claimed to support ‚Al˙ , preferring him to Abˆ Bakr and ‚Umar .As for the names ﬁIthn˜™ashriyyah,ﬂ meaning ﬁtwelver,ﬂ and ﬁIm˜miyyah,ﬂ from the root ﬁim˜m,ﬂ then it is due to their belief in a line of twelve im˜ms whom they claimed were ﬁma™sˆmﬂ (infallible). ˇese twelve are ‚Al˙ Ibn Ab˙ T˜lib and his two sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn, the three of whom were Sah˜bah ; then al-Husayn™s son ‚Al˙ as-Sajj˜d, his son Muhammad al-B˜qir, and then his son Ja™far as-S˜diq, the three of whom were all notable scholars famous for their R˚˛d˙ clerics pay tribute to dead Ira-nian JewsTHE R˜FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA˚ TO THE DAJJ˜L35great piety. After them came Ja™far™s son Mˆs˜ al-K˜dhim, his son ‚Al˙ ar-Rid˜, his son Muhammad al-Jaw˜d, his son ‚Al˙ al-H˜d˙, and then his son al-Hasan al-‚Askar˙. All of whom were famous for their piety. But none of these eleven was upon Rafd, except according to the fabrications propa-gated by the R˜˚dah.As for their twelfth ﬁim˜m,ﬂ then he is Muhammad the al-leged son of al-Hasan al-‚Askar˙. He is referred to as ﬁal-Mah-d˙ﬂ by the R˜˚dah. ˇey claim he was born in 255AH in Samarra of Iraq and that news of his birth was hidden from the public out of fear he would be killed by the khulaf˜™. ˇey claim that when he was ˚ve years old and his father passed away, he became the ﬁim˜mﬂ of his era and went into hiding after entering a cellar beneath his father™s home. ˇis period the R˜˚dah refer to as ﬁAl-Ghaybah as-Sughr˜ﬂ (the Minor Occultation). During this period, no one had con-tact with their so-called ﬁim˜mﬂ except for four ﬁdeputiesﬂ or ﬁemissaries,ﬂ who were his only link to the outside world. ˇis ﬁMinor Occultationﬂ lasted about 70 years, until the last so-called ﬁdeputyﬂ died in 329AH. ˇe R˜˚dah claim that shortly before his death, the last deputy received a letter from the ﬁMahd˙ﬂ stating, ﬁDeath will come to you within the next six days. So gather your strength. Do not designate anyone to replace you after your death. ˇe Major Occul-tation will commence with your demise. My reappearance will occur only by the permission of Allah, after a very long timeﬂ [Kam˜l ad-D˙n Œ Ibn B˜bawayh].However, at-Tabar˙, Ibn Hazm, and Yahy˜ Ibn S˜™id all re-ported that al-Hasan al-‚Askar˙ didn™t have any descendants [As-Siyar Œ adh-Dhahab˙]. Even if one were to claim that his immediate family had successfully hidden the reality of his birth from the masses for 72 years, how did he remain hidden from the world and live for almost 1200 years? If it were obligatory to believe so, it would have been mentioned in the Qur™˜n and the Sunnah. ˇus, there is no doubt that their ﬁmahd˙ﬂ is nothing but a fabrication amongst many by the lying R˜˚dah, who follow the footsteps of their B˜tin˙ brethren. Many of the B˜tiniyyah (heretical sects that claim the Qur™˜n has hidden meanings contrary to its apparent words) also believe in a hidden ﬁim˜mﬂ who went into oc-cultation and who has select ﬁdeputiesﬂ representing, calling to, or communicating with him. Most famous of these sects is the Ism˜™˙liyyah (the Seveners), who believe in the occul-tation of Muhammad Ibn Ism˜™˙l Ibn Ja™far as-S˜diq, who they claim was hidden by his father and grandfather, and will have a second coming.ˇese tenets of extreme ignorance and deviance is what led ash-Sha™b˙  to also say, ﬁI saw the R˜˚dah holding on to stems having no roots.3 If I wanted them to o˛er their necks to me as slaves, or ˚ll my house with gold, or perform pilgrimage to this house of mine so that I lie 3   I.e. they have claims and practices having no prophetic basis.just once upon the tongue of ‚Al˙ , they would do so. By Allah, I will never lie upon his tongue. Indeed, I have studied the people of desires and have not found any more foolish than the R˜˚dah. If they were birds, they would be vultures. And if they were beasts, they would be don-keys.ﬂ4˛e Ruling upon the R˜˙dahIn addition to their extreme ignorance and deviance, the R˜˚dah Œ both their leaders and laymen Œ are murtadd˙n. Am˙rul-Mu™min˙n Abˆ ‚Umar al-Husayn˙ al-Baghd˜d˙  said, ﬁˇe R˜˚dah are a party of shirk and apostasyﬂ [Qul Inn˙ ‚Al˜ Bayyinah Min Rabb˙].Shaykh Abˆ Mus™ab az-Zarq˜w˙  said, ﬁˇe statements of the Salaf pronouncing takf˙r upon the R˜˚dah are famous. Im˜m Ahmad  was asked about one who curses Abˆ Bakr, ‚Umar, or ‚™ishah. He replied, ‚I don™t consider him to be upon Islam™ [As-Sunnah Œ Al-Khall˜l]. He also said, ‚I fear kufr for those who Œ like the R˜˚dah Œ curse the Sah˜bah. We can safely say that one who curses the Sah˜bah of the Prophet  has left the religion™ [As-Sunnah Œ Al-Khall˜l]. He also said, ‚ˇe R˜˚dah are those who declare bar˜™ah from the Sah˜bah of Muhammad , curse them, degrade them, and curse the leaders of the Sah˜bah except for four: ‚Al˙, ‚Amm˜r, al-Miqd˜d, and Salm˜n. ˇe R˜˚dah have nothing to do with Islam at all™ [As-Sunnah]. Al-Bukh˜r˙  said, ‚It makes no di˛erence to me whether I were to pray behind a Jahm˙ or R˜˚d˙ or behind a Jew or Christian. ˇey are not to be greeted with sal˜m. ˇeir ill are not to be paid a sick visit. ˇey are not to be married. ˇeir funerals are not to be attended. ˇe meat they slaughter is not to be eaten™ [Khalq Af™˜l al-‚Ib˜d]. Ahmad Ibn Yˆnus  (died 227AH) said, ‚If a Jew were to slaughter a sheep and a R˜˚d˙ were to slaughter one, I would eat from the sheep slaughtered by the Jew and not eat from the one slaughtered by the R˜˚d˙, because the R˜˚d˙ is a murtadd™ [As-S˜rim al-Maslˆl Œ Ibn 4   See footnote #2.A R˚˛d˙ procession of shirk36Taymiyyah]. Ibn Hazm  said, ‚ˇe R˜˚dah are not from the Muslims™ [Al-Fisal]. Ibn Taymiyyah  said, ‚Whoever claims that some ˜y˜t of the Qur™˜n were deleted or hidden ... then there is no di˛erence of opinion on making takf˙r of him. Also, whoever claims that the Sah˜bah apostatized after Rasˆlull˜h  except a very few who didn™t exceed a dozen, or that they mostly became fuss˜q (major sinners), then there is no doubt on making takf˙r of him, because he has denied the praises of them that the Qur™˜n dictated in several places. Rather, whoever doubts the kufr of such a person, then takf˙r of him is obligatory. ˇis is because the meaning of this statement is that the transmitters of the Qur™˜n and the Sunnah were ku˛˜r or fuss˜q. It also means that those indicated by this verse {You are the best nation prmr˜n: 110], whose best generation was the ˚rst, were mostly ku˛˜r or fuss˜q. It also means that this Ummah was the worst of nations and the predecessors of this Ummah were the most evil of its peo-ple! ˇe kufr of such a person is known by necessity from the religion of Islam™ [As-S˜rim al-Maslˆl]. As-Sam™˜n˙ said, ‚ˇe Ummah has Ijm˜™ on takf˙r of the Im˜miyyah because they believe the Sah˜bah to be deviant and reject the Ijm˜™ of the Sah˜bah and attribute to them matters that are not be˚tting of them™ [Al-Ans˜b]™ﬂ [Abridged from ﬁHal At˜ka Had˙th ar-R˜˚dah 1ﬂ].Shaykh az-Zarq˜w˙  also said, ﬁˇe im˜ms of the Salaf pronounced takf˙r upon the R˜˚dah and exposed their re-ality – Im˜m M˜lik  said, ‚He who curses the Sah˜bah of Rasˆlull˜h  has no share of Islam™ [As-Sunnah Œ Al-Khall˜l]. M˜lik also commented on the following verse: {And the description of them [the Sah˜bah] in the Inj˙l is as a plant which produces its o˛shoots and strengthens them so they grow ˚rm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers Œ so that Allah may enrage by them the ku˛˜r} [Al-Fath: 29] by saying, ‚ˇus whoever is enraged by the Sah˜bah is a k˜˚r.™ Im˜m ash-Sh˜˚™˙ followed him in this deductionﬂ [Il˜ Ummat˙ al-Gh˜liyah].˛e Kufr˚ Tenets and Deeds of the R˜˙dahˇe reasons for pronouncing takf˙r upon the R˜˚dah are several, most important of which are:1) ˇey are the sect most famous for grave-worship amongst all deviant sects. Much grave-worship that entered into pockets of ﬁAhlus-Sunnahﬂ originated from Rafd and the R˜˚dah. Ibn Taymiyyah  said, ﬁˇe ˚rst to fabricate these ah˜d˙th about travelling to visit shrines built upon graves were the people of deviant heresies such as the R˜˚dah and their likesﬂ [Majmˆ™ al-Fat˜w˜].ˇe R˜˚dah now prostrate to graves and circumambulate them. ˇey supplicate the buried and seek intercession from them. ˇeir hearts are attached to them more than Allah! ˇis shirk˙ apostasy is something of which all of them Œ both their leaders and laymen Œ are guilty. If this were their only kufr, it would be more than su˝cient to declare them all apostates.2) ˇe R˜˚dah make takf˙r of the majority of the Sah˜bah, hate them, and curse them. Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wah-h˜b  said, ﬁˇe verses of the Qur™˜n about the virtues of the Sah˜bah are numerous and the ah˜d˙th on this are altogether mutaw˜tir explicitly stating their righteousness. ˇus whoever believes that the Sah˜bah or majority of them became f˜siq˙n or murtadd˙n or believes in the right or legality of cursing them has thereby disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, denying the virtues of the Sah˜bah that Allah and His Messenger relatedﬂ [Ar-Radd ‚Alar-R˜˚dah]. He also said, ﬁˇis is a demolition of the very basis of the religion, because its basis is the Qur™˜n and Had˙th. If it were assumed that those who learned from the Prophet  all apostatized except a very few whose number is meager, people would then doubt the Qur™˜n and the Had˙th. And we seek refuge from a creed that dictates the collapse of the religionﬂ [Ar-Radd ‚Alar-R˜˚dah].The shirk of the R˚˛dah includes grave-worshipTHE R˜FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA˚ TO THE DAJJ˜L37For this reason, most of the R˜˚dah Œ except those practic-ing taqiyyah (masking their kufr) Œ consider that ˜y˜t of the Qur™˜n were omitted, modi˚ed, and fabricated by the Sah˜-bah  and that therefore the Qur™˜n with Ahlus-Sunnah is incorrect and incomplete!3) In addition to their heretical stance towards the majori-ty of the Sah˜bah, the R˜˚dah especially emphasized their hatred and takf˙r of the best and most famous Sah˜bah in-cluding Abˆ Bakr, ‚Umar, and ‚Uthm˜n. ˇey did the same towards the wives of the Prophet especially ‚™ishah the daughter of Abˆ Bakr and Hafsah the daughter of ‚Umar . Can someone claim a mustard seed of faith while hat-ing the wives of the Prophet  and the best of his com-panions!Al-Awz˜™˙  (died 157AH) said, ﬁWhoever curses Abˆ Bakr as-Sidd˙q  has apostatizedﬂ [Al-Ib˜nah as-Sughr˜ Œ Ibn Battah]. Al-Firy˜b˙  (died 212AH) was asked about one who curses Abˆ Bakr. He replied, ﬁHe is a k˜˚rﬂ [As-Sun-nah Œ al-Khall˜l].4) ˇe R˜˚dah defame ‚™ishah  and her chastity and thereby the honor of the Prophet , clearly denying the Qur™˜n, as Allah  revealed verses 11 to 26 of Sˆrat an-Nˆr, declaring ‚™ishah™s innocence. And whoever belies a letter of the Qur™˜n is a k˜˚r. How much more so if he belies over a dozen verses of the Qur™˜n!Ibn Kath˙r commented in his tafs˙r, ﬁˇe scholars  have Ijm˜™ on that whoever curses ‚™ishah and accuses her [of in˚delity] after revelation of these verses and what was mentioned therein, then he is a k˜˚r for opposing the Qur™˜n.ﬂ5) ˇe R˜˚dah have fanatical love of the ﬁtwelveﬂ im˜ms preferring some of them to most of the Prophets  even attributing to them attributes of Allah™s lordship! ˇey claim that these im˜ms have control over the atoms of the universe, know the unseen, can abrogate the Qur™˜n, and deserve absolute obedience.After quoting various statements from the R˜˚dah showing this kufr of theirs, Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b  com-mented, ﬁWhoever claims that non-prophets are better or equal to the Prophets commits kufr. More than one scholar has reported Ijm˜™ on this [being kufr]ﬂ [Ar-Radd ‚Alar-R˜-˚dah].ˇe various forms of kufr held and practiced by the R˜˚dah are so numerous, especially as they innovate new devianc-es with every passing day while they simultaneously wage war against Islam and support the crusaders and apostates against the Muslims.˛e R˜˙dah According to the Jih˜d ClaimantsHowever, the various jih˜d claimants try to portray the R˜-˚dah as a sect of ignorant ﬁMuslims.ﬂ ˇese claimants rely upon two major shubuh˜t to justify their claim.1) ˇe claim that the R˜˚dah are excused due to ignorance: ˇe jih˜d claimants use this argument as armor to shield thereby the R˜˚dah from the takf˙r and war of the mu-wahhid˙n. If the muj˜hid˙n blow up R˜˚d˙ neighborhoods in Iraq with massive car bombs, the jih˜d claimants cry out, ﬁYou are killing ignorant and innocent Muslims! You should be giving them da™wah, not killing them! Our war is only against America!ﬂˇis doubt has been responded to numerous times. In brief, if a claimant of Islam worships anything or anyone besides Allah, mocks Allah, or completely abandons submission to Him, then he cannot be considered a Muslim. Islam is sin-cerity towards Allah and submission to Him. Its testimony declares that there is none worthy of worship and obedience except Allah. One of its prerequisites is knowledge; and one of its nulli˚ers is turning away from learning the very basics of Islam. Contrary to the Murji™ah and their brethren from the jih˜d claimants, Islam is not a super˚cial claim having no reality. If it were so, most of the con˘icts between the Muslims and ku˛˜r would have been resolved without the need for war. But it is this reality Œ that faith is word and deed Œ that spites the ku˛˜r the most. ˇey wish that just as they have abandoned most of the deeds mandated by their distorted Tawr˜h and Inj˙l while holding on to the name of ﬁChristianity,ﬂ the Muslims would do the same. {ˇey wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be the same} [An-Nis˜™: 89].5Ibn Ab˙ Butayn  (died 1282AH) criticized those who ex-cuse the likes of the R˜˚d˙ laymen, saying, ﬁIf a person were to say about the R˜˚dah of the era that they are excused 5   Irj˜™ in general as well as this exaggerated understanding of ignorance being an excuse has been refuted in several articles of D˜biq. See issue 8, ﬁIrj˜™ Œ ˇe Most Dangerous Bid™ah,ﬂ issue 7, ﬁIslam Is the Religion of the Sword,ﬂ issue 6, ﬁˇe Q˜™idah of adh-Dhaw˜hir˙ – And the Absent Yemeni Wisdom,ﬂ and issue 10, ﬁˇe Law of Allah or the Laws of Men.ﬂA R˚˛d˙ procession of shirk38due to ignorance with regards to their cursing of Abˆ Bakr, ‚Umar, and ‚™ishah because the R˜˚dah are ignorant blind followers, both the scholars and laymen would condemn him!ﬂ [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah].ˇat was over a century ago and on the issue of cursing major Sah˜bah. How much more deserving of condemna-tion is one who excuses the R˜˚dah with regards to major shirk!2) ˇe claim that some scholars did not make takf˙r of all the R˜˚dah: ˇis claim is a twisting of one of two matters.First: ˇey refer to scholars who did not make takf˙r of all the ﬁSh˙™ah,ﬂ which is a label more general than that of the R˜˚dah, as it includes those who preferred ‚Al˙ to Abˆ Bakr and ‚Umar while still recognizing the Khil˜fah of Abˆ Bakr and ‚Umar and their companionship. ˇis is an extinct phe-nomenon, now only existing in historical books describing ahlul-bida™. As for the contemporary Zaydiyyah, then they have been R˜˚dized by Iranian propaganda, making them a sect engaged in cursing the Sah˜bah after already imitating the R˜˚dah in grave worship.Second: ˇey refer to some scholars who did not make tak-f˙r of the R˜˚dah, each and every one. However their fat˜w˜ should be understood in the context of history, as the lead-ers of the R˜˚dah had practiced taqiyyah for centuries while living under the authority of the Muslims, concealing many aspects of their religion from the Sunn˙ scholars, the pub-lic, and even from their own laymen until the rise of the Safaw˙ state under the leadership of Ism˜™˙l as-Safaw˙ in the tenth century after the Hijrah. ˇereafter, they ˘agrantly declared their B˜tin˙ creed of kufr and shamelessly mani-fested what it dictated to them of major shirk, openly invit-ing their zealous hordes to a religion of blatant kufr, leaving no R˜˚d˙ layman innocent of apostasy. It was during this ﬁrevivalﬂ that Muhammad B˜qir al-Majlis˙ emerged as top religious o˝cial of the Safaw˙ state. He wrote several in˘u-ential books and spread ﬁrevivalistﬂ propaganda, leaving a lasting e˛ect on Rafd and the R˜˚dah.‚Abdull˜h Ibn Muhammad Ibn ‚Abdil-Wahh˜b  said after mentioning the fatw˜ of Ibn Taymiyyah in which he pro-nounced takf˙r upon the R˜˚dah who make takf˙r of the majority of the Sah˜bah, ﬁˇis was the ruling upon them to begin with. As for their later generations and now, then they have added major shirk to their Rafd. ˇey practice this shirk at shrines to an extent that even the Arabs to whom Rasˆlull˜h  was sent to did not reachﬂ [Ad-Durar as-San-iyyah].Muhammad Ibn ‚Ahaykh  likewise said after mentioning Ibn Taymiyyah™s fatw˜, ﬁˇis was the rul-ing upon them to begin with. As for now, then their situa-tion is much worse, as they have added to this deviance their worship of the awliy˜™ and the righteous from Ahlul-Bayt, believing that Ahlul-Bayt can bene˚t and harm them, sup-plicating them both in times of hardship and ease. ˇey believe that this is a deed that gets them closer to Allah and a religion that they must adhere to. So whoever is in doubt of their takf˙r after such, then he is ignorant of the reality of what the messengers came with and what the books were revealed with. He must therefore review his religion before the coming time of his burialﬂ [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah].Shaykh Hamd al-Humayd˙  Œ one of the scholars recently killed by Salˆl and who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State Œ commented on Ibn ‚Abdil-Lat˙f™s words, say-ing, ﬁˇat was in his era, so how would it be if he were to see this era and the manifestation of their shirk in Makkah and al-Mad˙nah, and at al-Baq˙™ graveyard and elsewhere?ﬂ He later comments, ﬁˇus their males, females, laymen, and scholars are thereby ku˛˜rﬂ [Aqw˜l Ahlil-Isl˜m Fil-Hukm ‚Alar-R˜˚dah].6Shaykh az-Zarq˜w˙  responded to al-Maqdis˙™s criticisms of the operations against the R˜˚dah similarly [Bay˜n wa Tawd˙h Lim˜ Ath˜rahul-Maqdis˙].Twisting the select words of a few scholars to claim that the R˜˚dah are ﬁMuslims,ﬂ is equivalent to taking the state-ments of the Salaf against the Su˚s of their era Œ those ear-ly Su˚s whose mistakes were limited to exaggerated zuhd and wasw˜s Œ and then misapplying these statements to the grave-worshipping, Jahm˙ Su˚s of later eras, thereby claim-ing that just as the early Su˚s were misguided Muslims, the later mushrik Su˚s are also misguided ﬁMuslimsﬂ! Allah™s refuge is sought from such perversion of the truth.6   In his piece, he  quotes several of the scholars from the Salaf on their takf˙r of the R˜˚dah. ˇose not mentioned elsewhere in this article include: ‚Abdull˜h Ibn al-Hasan Ibn al-Hasan Ibn Ab˙ T˜lib (died 145AH), ‚Abdull˜h Ibn Mus™ab Ibn ˇ˜bit Ibn ‚Abdull˜h Ibn az-Zubayr (died 184AH), ‚Abdur-Rahm˜n Ibn Mahd˙ (died 198AH), ‚Abdur-Razz˜q as-San™˜n˙ (died 211AH), al-Q˜sim Ibn Sal˜m (died 224AH), Bishr Ibn al-H˜rith (died 227AH), Abˆ Zur™ah ar-R˜z˙ (died 264AH), and Abˆ H˜tim ar-R˜z˙ (died 277AH). May Allah have mercy upon them all.The R˚˛d˙ t˚gh˝t, ﬁAyatollahﬂ KhomeiniTHE R˜FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA˚ TO THE DAJJ˜L39Jih˜d Claimant PerversionsAdh-Dhaw˜hir˙ said, ﬁWe consider the Twelver Sh˙™ah one of the mubtadi™ sects that innovated bid™ah in creed that reached the point of cursing Abˆ Bakr, ‚Umar, the Mothers of the Believers, and the majority of the Sah˜bah and T˜-bi™˙n. ˇey consider them to be ku˛˜r, they openly curse them, and they consider the Qur™˜n to have been distorted – and they have other innovated beliefs such as claiming the infallibility of the twelve im˜ms and that these im˜ms reached a level that neither a prophet nor angel has reached – As for those who are ignorant and believe in these false tenets due to ah˜d˙th they thought to be authentic while the truth had not reached them or due to them being ignorant laymen, then they are excused due to ignoranceﬂ [Mawqi-fun˜ Min r˜n].He also said in his infamous letter censuring Shaykh az-Zarq˜w˙ , ﬁIf attacking some of the heads of the Sh˙™ah is necessary [as you claim], then why do you attack the lay-men of the Sh˙™ah? Doesn™t this lead to their false beliefs taking root deeper in their hearts, whereas the obligation upon us is to speak to them with da™wah and clarify and convey the truth to them so that they might be guided to it? Will the muj˜hid˙n ever be able to kill all the Sh˙™ah of Iraq? Did any Islamic state in history ever try to do so? Why are the laymen of the Sh˙™ah killed despite them being excused due to their ignorance? And what would we have suppos-edly lost if we had not targeted the Sh˙™ah? – And do our brothers forget that both we and Iran are in need of each other not harming one another during this era in which the Americans target us both?ﬂHe said in another letter censuring the targeting of R˜-˚d˙ temples, markets, and neighborhoods that he believes ﬁthese deeds spill inviolable blood, as the blood of the wom-en, children, and commoners of the Sh˙™ah Œ except their ˚ghters Œ is inviolable, because they are excused due to ig-norance.ﬂ He then goes on to say mockingly, ﬁDo you want to kill all the Sh˙™ah of Iraq? ˇen follow them up by killing all the Sh˙™ah of the Arabian Gulf and Peninsula? ˇen the Sh˙™ah of Iran, Sh˜m, and the rest of the world?!ﬂHe also said, ﬁ[ˇe muj˜hid˙n] must not ˚ght the deviant sects such as the R˜˚dah, the Ism˜™˙liyyah, the Q˜diy˜ni-yyah, and the deviant Su˚s, as long as these sects do not ˚ght Ahlus-Sunnah. If they ˚ght Ahlus-Sunnah, then the re-sponse should be limited to the ˚ghters of these sects, while at the same time we must clarify that we are only defending ourselves. We must avoid striking their non-˚ghters, their families, their homes, their places of worship, their celebra-tions, and their religious gatherings – As for the areas that fall under the control and authority of the muj˜hid˙n, then these sects should be treated with wisdom after da™wah, promoting awareness, exposing shubuh˜t, and command-ing the good and forbidding the evil in a manner that does not lead to a greater harm, such as the muj˜hid˙n being cast out of those regions or the masses revolting against them or a ˚tnah being instigated that the enemies of the muj˜hid˙n will exploit to occupy these regionsﬂ [General Guidelines for Jih˜d˙ Activism].Adh-Dhaw˜hir˙™s policies towards the R˜˚dah are clearly based upon his deviant belief that they are ﬁMuslims.ﬂ As for his claim that no Islamic state throughout history ever attempted to kill o˛ the R˜˚dah, then that is due to his ignorance. ˇe Twelver R˜˚dah had not existed during the eras of the R˜shid˙, Umaw˙, and ‚Abb˜s˙ khulaf˜™ as they exist today, for the sect had been a minority practicing taqiyyah, never having the political power nor the military might to manifest and propagate their blatant kufr and shirk, a condition changed by the advent of the Safaw˙ state four hundred years ago.As for the nationalist Taliban, then they are similar to Dhaw˜hir˙™s Q˜™idah, considering the R˜˚dah to be their brothers and publically denouncing those who target the R˜˚dah.‚Abdull˜h al-Waz˙r, the o˝cial correspondent of the nation-alist Taliban media committee, said, ﬁˇe Sh˙™ah are Mus-lims – Everyone who says there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is Allah™s Messenger is a Muslim. ˇe sects are many and Allah will decide between them on Judgment Day.ﬂˇe nationalist Taliban also boasted of their gatherings with the R˜˚d˙ o˝cials of Iran, saying, ﬁRecently a high-rank-ing delegation led by Muhammad Tayyib Agha, the pres-ident of the political o˝ce of the Islamic Emirate, visited the neighboring state of Iran. During the visit, the dele-gation discussed with Iranian o˝cials the current situation 40in Afghanistan, the region, and the Muslim world, and the condition of the Afghan refugees in Iran. It should be noted that this visit was a part of many regular visits that the Islamic Emirate delegation makes to various countries of the world for the sake of discussing bilateral topics as well as building, expanding, and strengthening relationsﬂ [Statement of the O˝cial Spokesman of the Emirate on a High-Ranking Delegation Sent to Iran].ˇe nationalist Taliban also defended the R˜˚d˙ state of Iran Œ both its government and public Œ saying, ﬁˇe Islam-ic Emirate of Afghanistan denounces the new punishments by the Security Council against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the censures against this country and its people. ˇe Emirate considers these decrees invalid. ˇe Islamic Emir-ate, in accordance with its stance of sympathizing with na-tions, considers the last and previous economic threats from the Security Council to be a great transgression and oppres-sion against the rights of Iran and its people. In this regards, we say that the harmful e˛ects and negative consequences of these warnings fall directly upon the public of Iran. So we demand that all matters be resolved and all problems settled through discussion and understandingﬂ [Statement from the Political Committee of the Emirate on Several Events regarding Afghanistan and the World].ˇe nationalist Taliban also condemned attacks against their R˜˚d˙ brothers, saying, ﬁTwo explosions occurred in an unknown manner on ‚™ day the 10th of Muharram 1433AH this year inside Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif leading a number of our persecuted unarmed citizens being soaked with their own blood and leading their families to sit at gatherings of grief and mourning. From the very beginning, the Islamic Emirate strongly and severely condemned and denounced these two incidents. On 15-1-1433AH, the head shˆr˜ assembly of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan held an emergency meeting in this regards. Comprehensive discussions were held about the two incidents in the gath-ering. ˇe o˝cials considered that this act to be a conspir-acy plotted by the defeated enemy. It was resolved that our attentive nation must be intelligently alert for such deeds and acts done by the enemy and not allow anyone to ignite enmity, animosity, and division amongst our united nation whether based on sect, tribe, language, or region so as to prevent them from reaching their sinister and despicable goals. ˇe shˆr˜ assembly also requested that all political and denominational parties in the country give the inter-ests of the people and nation priority to their speci˚c and partisan interests during such crises. ˇey should not make any statements that seek to serve their political goals thereby harming the unity of our nation in a manner that will only cast more oil on the ˚re the enemy has lit.ﬂﬁDuring the gathering, it was also emphasized that the enemy at critical moments like this before his imminent withdrawal will extend his hand, in accordance with his despicable habit to exploit incidents like the sad day of ‚™. He strives to plant the seeds of hypocrisy and di-vision between the united Afghan nation so as to break up their unity. ˇis is because the enemy has failed in achiev-ing all his schemes and conspiracies, so he wants to exploit this event as a bayonet by which he takes revenge against our oppressed and poor nation for all his defeats. But our alert and united nation will not lose patience. It will not be reckless. It will never be fooled by the likes of these schemes done by the enemy. ˇis scheme of theirs will fail like all the other schemes and conspiracies. At the end of the gathering after discussing the two incidents from all the angles, the following statement was released containing the following points.ﬂﬁ1) ˇe Islamic Emirate o˛ers its condolences to the fam-ed by these two inci-dents. It also severely condemns all the likes of these inci-dents. 2) ˇe Islamic Emirate considers these incidents to be the deeds and schemes of the occupation and enemies of Afghanistan. It calls all citizens to ful˚ll their Islamic responsibility then their national responsibility and coop-erate with each other to prevent any similar incidents, be-cause, like this incident, the acts of the enemy are against all citizens and harm our motherly Afghanistan. 3) ˇe Islamic Emirate especially requests that all the scholars and prominent ˚gures of the Sh˙™ah in Afghanistan be fully alert after what took place against them and teach their people the reality, which is that the matter is not at all that of enmity between Ahlus-Sunnah and the Sh˙™ah. ˇey should not pay attention to any irresponsible state-ments from some of the domestic agents of the enemy, those who give this incident the image of being sectarian and domestic spite. ˇese agents do so to achieve their personal goals and satisfy their masters. 4) ˇe Islamic Emirate directs all its muj˜hid˙n to ful˚ll their responsi-bilities and carry out the tasks they have been assigned by focusing very much on preventing such atrocious acts from being repeatedﬂ [Report on the Emergency Gather-The nationalist Taliban denounce attacks carried out against the R˚-˛dahTHE R˜FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA˚ TO THE DAJJ˜L41ing of the Leading Shˆr˜ Assembly of the Emirate and the Statement Released on the Two Attacks on ‚™ Day in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif].7ˇey send their condolences to the R˜˚dah and declare their willingness to cooperate with them against the mu-j˜hid˙n!˛e Zarq˜w˚ Manhaj on the R˜˙dahIt is best that one contrasts this deviance of Dhaw˜hir˙ and the nationalist Taliban with Shaykh az-Zarq˜w˙™s plan to cleanse Iraq of the R˜˚dah.Shaykh Abˆ Mus™ab  said in his famous letter to Shaykh Us˜mah Ibn L˜din , ﬁˇe R˜˚dah are the insurmount-able obstacle, the lurking snake, the scorpion of deception and malice, the prowling enemy, the deadly poison. We here wage a war at two levels. ˇe ˚rst war is open and exposed with an aggressive enemy and clear kufr. ˇe second war is a di˝cult and ˚erce one with a scheming enemy who dresses like a friend, shows approval, and calls to unity, while he conceals evil and plots day and night, after obtaining the heritage of all the B˜tin˙ sects that had appeared throughout history, leaving a scar upon his face that the days cannot re-move. ˇe precise observer and wise scrutinizer realizes that Shiism is the immediate danger and real challenge. {ˇey are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?} [Al-Mun˜˚qˆn: 4]. ˇe message of history is con˚rmed by the testimony of current events, clearly informing the world that Shiism is a religion that does not agree with Islam except like how the Jews gather with the Christians under the label of ‚People of the Book.™ Shiism contains everything from blatant shirk, to grave worship, to circumambulating tombs, to takf˙r of the Sah˜-bah, to cursing the Mothers of the Believers and the best of this Ummah, to claiming distortion of the Qur™˜n Œ a logical result of their defamation of its carriers Œ in addition to the claim of the infallibility of the im˜ms and that belief in them and recognition of their reception of revelation are a basis of faith as well as other forms of kufr and manifesta-tions of zandaqah that their authoritative books and prima-ry references over˘ow with. And they do not cease to print, distribute, and publish these books and references.ﬂﬁˇe dreamers who think that the Shiite can forget his his-torical heritage and ancient black spite towards the Naw˜sib Œ as the R˜˚dah label Ahlus-Sunnah Œ is mistaken. He is like someone who demands the ‚Christian™ abandon the idea of the Messiah being cruci˚ed [and still call himself a ‚Christian™]. Does an intelligent man do so?ﬂ7   Adh-Dhaw˜hir˙ as well as the Taliban leadership have many more statements in defense of the R˜˚dah. See, for example, D˜biq, issue 6, ﬁˇe Q˜™idah of adh-Dhaw˜hir˙ – And the Absent Yemeni Wisdom.ﬂHe then said, ﬁˇe R˜˚dah are a party of treachery and treason throughout history and the ages. It is a sect whose war is directed against Ahlus-Sunnah.ﬂHe then goes on to explain that the R˜˚dah were begin-ning to dissolve their militias and join the newly formed Iraqi government, army, and security under the sight of the Americans and with American aid. ˇe R˜˚dah knew a direct con˘ict between them and Ahlus-Sunnah would only harm R˜˚d˙ interests by awakening Ahlus-Sunnah to jih˜d. ˇe R˜˚dah believed that such a con˘ict would have to be delayed until the stabilization of a crusader-backed government controlled by the R˜˚dah themselves. And they committed many crimes against Ahlus-Sunnah before the establishment of such a government, but always covert-ly, killing many muj˜hid˙n, scholars, intellectuals, doctors, and engineers, while taking advantage of the fact that un-like the very obvious Americans, the R˜˚dah spoke Arabic, looked Iraqi, and knew the Iraqi territory well. ˇis made them a greater obstacle and more dangerous enemy than the Americans. ˇe R˜˚dah also exploited the naivety of some of Ahlus-Sunnah, by practicing taqiyyah and hiding their kufr and animosity. As a result of these schemes, most muj˜hid˙n killed during the initial American invasion were actually killed by the R˜˚dah.After this discussion, he stated, ﬁˇe R˜˚dah: ˇey are the key to change. I mean they should be targeted and struck in their religious, political, and military core. ˇis will provoke The murtadd Iraqi security forces made up of pagan R˚˛dah42them to manifest their rancor against Ahlus-Sunnah and bare the teeth of the B˜tin˙ spite festering in their chests. If we succeed, it is possible to awaken the neglectful Sun-nis, as they will feel the imminent danger and approaching death upon the hands of these Saba™iyyah [followers of Ibn Saba™]. Ahlus-Sunnah, despite their weakness and division, are sharper blades and more resolved and truthful on the battle˚eld than these B˜tiniyyah, for the R˜˚dah are a peo-ple of treachery and cowardice. ˇey only assail the weak. ˇey only assault the helpless. Ahlus-Sunnah in general un-derstand the danger of these people and are cautious and fearful of the results of such consolidation being granted to the R˜˚dah. If it were not for the cowardly dissuading heads of Su˚sm and the Ikhw˜n, the people would have been much better o˛.ﬂﬁˇis matter, in addition to what is anticipated from it of awakening those who are in slumber, will also trim the nails of these R˜˚dah and pull out their canines before the in-evitable war. It is also anticipated to incite the anger of the people against the Americans, who brought this destruction and who were the cause of this evil. It will also deter the people from enjoying leisure and achieving some of the de-lights they were prohibited before, which would make them succumb to comfort, cling to the earth, prefer safety, and turn them back from the clashing of swords and neighing of steeds.ﬂﬁˇe Method of Operation: Our condition dictates that we deal with the matter with courage and clarity and endeav-or for a solution – ˇe solution as we believe, and Allah knows best, is to expose the R˜˚dah and raise the resolve of Ahlus-Sunnah to ˚ght them and stop them. ˇis is for several reasons: A) ˇe R˜˚dah have declared a hidden war against the Muslims. ˇey are the close and dangerous ene-my to Ahlus-Sunnah. Even though the Americans are also a major enemy, but the R˜˚dah are more severely dangerous and more murderous towards the Ummah than the Amer-icans – B) ˇey took the Americans as allies, supported them, stood in their ranks in the face of the muj˜hid˙n, and sacri˚ced and continue to sacri˚ce for the Americans everything precious so as to end jih˜d and the muj˜hid˙n. C) Our war against the R˜˚dah is a way to incite and raise the resolve of the Ummah for this battle.ﬂHe  also said elsewhere, ﬁIt is not possible for the Muslims to achieve victory against the hostile ku˛˜r from the Jews and Christians except by abolishing those apostate agents Œ especially the R˜˚dah Œ near the Muslims. ˇis is what history observed for us, as Baytul-Maqdis, which fell in the hands of the Crusaders with the aid of the ‚Ubayd˙ R˜˚-dah, was not taken back except at the hands of Sal˜hudd˙n, despite Nˆrudd˙n Mahmˆd being harsher against the Cru-saders than Sal˜hudd˙n. But Allah  declared that victory and liberation of Baytul-Maqdis would be upon the hands of Sal˜hudd˙n. But when? After he fought the ‚Ubayd˙ R˜˚-dah for years and completely abolished and destroyed their state. ˇereafter, he dedicated his e˛orts to the war against the Crusaders until victory was achieved and he retook Bay-tul-Maqdis, which had been for years in the hands of the Crusaders due to the treachery of the R˜˚dah.ﬂﬁˇis is a very important lesson that history presents to us. One should not be heedless of this lesson. We will never have victory against the asl˙ ku˛˜r8  except after also ˚ghting murtadd ku˛˜r in addition to the asl˙ ku˛˜r. ˇe Islamic victories that took place during the era of al-Khulaf˜™ ar-R˜shid˙n came only after cleansing the Arabian Peninsula of the apostatesﬂ [Hal At˜ka Had˙th ar-R˜˚dah].ˇe di˛erence between the two methodologies is due to the issue of takf˙r. Shaykh Abˆ Mus™ab considered the blood of the R˜˚dah obligatory to spill, so he did not hesitate in ex-ecuting operations that lead to their deaths. Every day, the R˜˚d˙ cities and neighborhoods of Iraq were targeted with car bombs and truck bombs. In contrast, adh-Dhaw˜hir˙ considers that the ˚lthy blood of the R˜˚dah is har˜m to spill, and so he censures any attempt at reviving jih˜d against these pagan apostates!Are the R˜˙dah Apostates or Kuˆ˜r Asliyy˚n?ˇis question has confused some of the ignorant, as they thought that declaring the R˜˚dah to be apostates neces-sitated that the R˜˚d˙ raised upon Rafd was once really a ﬁMuslim.ﬂ ˇese ignorant people then claimed that whoev-er declared the R˜˚dah to be apostates himself apostatizes, as according to them he had declared kufr to be Islam.9 But their understanding is nothing but falsehood.Talhah Ibn Musarrif  (died 112AH) said, ﬁˇe women 8    Editor™s Note: ˇe k˜˚r asl˙ is a k˜˚r having nothing to do with Islam, like the Jews, Christians, Hindus, etc. As for the k˜˚r who was once a Muslim and became a Jew or Christian, then he is a murtadd. Likewise, the ku˛˜r who mix ﬁIslamﬂ with kufr and shirk Œ such as the R˜˚dah, the taw˜gh˙t, and the Nusayriyyah Œ then they are also murtadd˙n.9   An example of this ignorant phenomenon was reported in D˜biq, issue 6, ﬁDismantling a Kh˜rij˙ Cell,ﬂ page 31.THE R˜FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA˚ TO THE DAJJ˜L43of the R˜˚dah are not to be married. ˇe meat the R˜˚dah slaughter should not be eaten. ˇis is because they are a people of apostasyﬂ [Al-Ib˜nah as-Sughr˜ Œ Ibn Battah].ˇe ruling of apostasy upon the R˜˚dah as a sect and in-dividuals was quoted earlier from numerous scholars from various eras. It was also the verdict of Ibn Taymiyyah and others upon the B˜tiniyyah including the Druze, the Nu-sayriyyah, and the Ism˜™˙liyyah, all of which were sects that formed centuries before these scholars. ˇis ruling has noth-ing to do with the individual R˜˚d˙ or B˜tin˙ ever actually being a Muslim ful˚lling the prerequisites of Islam. And similar to the ruling of a person who hypocritically claims Islam and then later declares his hypocrisy or a Jew that pronounces the shah˜dah but claims he was just joking, the person raised as a R˜˚d˙ is treated as an apostate, although he had never truly been Muslim. ˇis has been the ruling of scholars for centuries regarding any apostate sect.10ˇis ruling dictates that the R˜˚dah are to be treated with the sword against riddah, which di˛ers from the sword against kufr asl˙. ˇe di˛erence between the two swords is as follows: 1) ˇe murtadd can be killed after he is taken prisoner even if he declares repentance. 2) ˇe murtadd cannot pay jizyah to become a dhimm˙. 3) A treaty cannot be signed with the murtadd˙n. 4) Murtadd men cannot be enslaved. 5) A murtadd cannot be released for ransom. 6) A murtadd cannot be released as clemency. 7) A murtadd can be forced back into Islam. Etc. 11ˇe claim that the R˜˚dah are ku˛˜r asliyy˙n implies that they must not be killed after repenting in captivity, that 10   ˇe ˚rst to claim otherwise was as-San™˜n˙ (died 1182AH). His opinion was criticized by ‚Ahaykh (died 1293AH) in ﬁMisb˜h adh-Dhal˜m.ﬂ11   ˇe details on these matters can be found in the books of ˚qh.they could remain R˜˚dah, pay jizyah, and become from ahludh-dhimmah, that a treaty could be signed with them, that their men could be enslaved, that they could be released out of clemency or for ransom, and that they should not be forced into Islam! A deviant ignoramus might even claim they are more suited to be considered from Ahlul-Kit˜b than the Jews and Christians, as the R˜˚dah have a kit˜b, although they consider it distorted!If one searched the books of ˜th˜r from the Salaf, he would not ˚nd any precedence for these odd opinions. Finally, the fact that the R˜˚dah are apostates necessitates more severity when applying the sword of jih˜d to their ˚lthy necks.˛e Crimes of the R˜˙dah against Ahlus-SunnahSufy˜n Ibn ‚Uyaynah  (died 198AH) said, ﬁNo one holds animosity towards one of the Sah˜bah of Rasˆlull˜h  ex-cept while holding more animosity towards the rest of the Muslimsﬂ [Al-Ib˜nah as-Sughr˜ Œ Ibn Battah].Wall˜hi, he spoke the truth. How can someone hold an-imosity towards Abˆ Bakr as-Sidd˙q and his daughter From the crimes of the R˚˛dah against Ahlus-Sunnah in Iran44‚™ishah Œ the two people the Prophet declared to be the most beloved persons to him on earth Œ and then not hate the common Muslims even more?! ˇus, the R˜˚dah played a role in almost every conspiracy launched against Islam.Ibn Taymiyyah said, ﬁBecause they consider the Mus-lims to have worse kufr than the Jews and Christians, they take the enemies of the religion as their close allies, those whose enmity everyone knows of, like the Jews, Christians, and pagans. ˇey have enmity towards the awliy˜™ of Allah who are the best people of the religion and the leaders of the piousﬂ [Minh˜j as-Sunnah]. He also said, ﬁEvery intelligent individual should re˘ect upon the episodes of evil, ˚tnah, and corruption in his era and before that. He will ˚nd the majority of these episodes are from the R˜˚dah. You will ˚nd them to be the worst of people in making ˚tnah and evilﬂ [Minh˜j as-Sunnah].ˇerefore, Shaykh az-Zarq˜w˙  said, ﬁBy recalling histor-ical experiences, testimonies of past eras, signs of current events, and the experiences we live today, we will under-stand truly the meaning of {ˇey are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?} [Al-Mun˜˚qˆn: 4]. ˇroughout history, they have been a pang in the throats of the Muslims, a dagger in their backs, the rat that destroyed the dam, and the bridge over which the enemies of the Ummah pass.ﬂﬁShaykhul-Isl˜m Ibn Taymiyyah spoke the truth when he described their condition after describing their takf˙r of the Muslims, he  said, ‚For this reason, they help the ku˛˜r against the Muslim masses. ˇey also helped the Mongols. ˇey were one of the biggest reasons for Genghis Khan, the king of the ku˛˜r, invading the Muslim lands. ˇey were also the reason for Hulagu Khan™s invasion of Iraq, taking of Aleppo, and plundering of as-S˜lihiyyah. ˇey also have many other treacheries they committed with their malice and deception. For this reason, they plundered the Muslim army as it travelled near them on its way back to Egypt after the ˚rst episode. For this reason, via armed robbery, they devastate the highways of the Muslims. For this rea-son, they supported the Mongols and the Franks against the Muslims. ˇe biggest sorrow was manifested by them when Islam again became victorious. Similarly, when the Muslims conquered the shores of ‚Akkah and its nearby regions, the R˜˚dah supported the Christians and preferred them to the Muslims – All that I described is just a part of their evil, whereas the matter is much greater. ˇere is rancor and rage in their chests Œ the likes of which can be found in no other people™s hearts Œ directed to all ranks and levels of Muslims. According to them, the greatest act of worship is to curse the awliy˜™ of Allah – ˇe R˜˚dah are the people who strive the most to divide the Jam˜™ah of the Muslims. One of their greatest principles is to make takf˙r of and curse the best of the Muslim leaders like al-Khul˜f˜™ ar-R˜shid˙n and the scholars, because everyone who does not believe in the infallible nonexistent im˜m has not believed in Al-lah and His Messenger . ˇe R˜˚dah love the Mongols and their state, because through it they achieved honor the likes of which they could not achieve in a Muslim state. If the Muslims conquer the Christians and mushrik˙n, it is a pang in the throats of the R˜˚dah. If the mushrik˙n and Christians conquer the Muslims, it is a celebration and joy for the R˜˚dah™ [Majmˆ™ al-Fat˜w˜]. ˇat ends his words, rahimahull˜h. It is as if he lives amongst us describing what he witnessed with his own eyes, when he says, ‚And likewise, if the Jews establish a state in Iraq or elsewhere, the R˜˚-dah would be from their greatest supporters, because they always support the ku˛˜r from the mushrik˙n, the Jews, and the Christians. ˇey help them in ˚ghting and waging war against the Muslims™ [Majmˆ™ al-Fat˜w˜]ﬂ [Il˜ Ummat˙ al-Gh˜liyah].ˇe R˜˚dah were behind the early ˚tan during the reigns of ‚Uthm˜n, ‚Al˙, and Mu™˜wiyah . ˇe R˜˚dah were be-hind the death of al-Husayn . ˇe R˜˚dah waged war against the ‚Abb˜s˙ Khil˜fah via the so-called ﬁF˜tim˙ﬂ state. ˇey supported the Mongols against the ‚Abb˜s˙ Khulaf˜™ and the Muslim kings thereafter. ˇey supported the Franks and the Crusaders in their invasions of Sh˜m and Palestine. ˇey waged war against Ahlus-Sunnah through the Safaw˙ state. ˇey aided the Americans in their invasions of Af-ghanistan and Iraq. ˇey supported the Nusayr˙ regime in Sh˜m and established a R˜˚d˙ militia-state in Yemen. ˇey will continue to wage war against the Muslims until the R˜˚dah ultimately unite with the Jews under the banner of the Dajj˜l.˛e R˜˙dah and the Dajj˜lˇe Prophet  warned very much of the Dajj˜l, even ordering the Muslim to seek refuge with Allah from the evil ˚tnah of the Dajj˜l ˚ve times a day. ˇe Prophet  also described many of the Dajj˜l™s attributes. In the Sun-nah, the Dajj˜l is described as having red in his skin tone THE R˜FIDAH: FROM IBN SABA˚ TO THE DAJJ˜LThe R˚˛dah™s animosity towards Ah-lus-Sunnah is constantly on display wherever they are found45and being bulky [Reported by al-Bukh˜r˙ and Muslim from Ibn ‚Umar]. His hair is also described as being very curly [Reported by Muslim from Ibn ‚Umar]. He is also described as being tan [Reported by Im˜m Ahmad from Jun˜dah Ibn Ab˙ Umayyah]. He is also described as being Jewish [Reported by Muslim from Abˆ Sa™˙d al-Khudr˙]. He is also described as being on an island in the eastern seas, chained and imprisoned [Reported by Muslim from F˜timah Bint Qays]. He is described as coming from the East on his way to al-Mad˙nah [Reported by Muslim from Abˆ Hurayrah]. ˇe earth is folded for him so that he can cover it in forty days [Reported by Ibn Hibb˜n from F˜timah Bint Qays]. He will not leave a single fountain on the earth except that he will stop at it [Reported by Im˜m Ahmad from J˜bir]. He will pass by ruins and order it to produce forth its treasures; the treasures will then follow him like bees [Reported by Muslim from an-Naww˜s Ibn Sam™˜n].ˇe above-mentioned traits are similar to those of the so-called ﬁMahd˙ﬂ described in the books of the R˜˚dah. His hair is very curly [Ilz˜m an-N˜sib Œ al-H˜™ir˙]. He is tan [Al-Ghaybah Œ at-Tˆs˙]. He has a big belly [Al-Ghaybah Œ an-Nu™m˜n˙]. He has red in his skin tone [Al-Ghaybah Œ an-Nu™m˜n˙].

He will have the tablets of Mˆs˜ [Al-K˜f˙ Œ al-Kulayn˙].Undoubtedly, these fabricated narrations falsely attributed to Ahlul-Bayt actually describe the Dajj˜l Œ the ﬁMessiahﬂ of the Jews. Despite these reports all being fabrications, the R˜˚dah strive to follow what the lies dictate, as they con-sider them the greatest pillar of their religion. Were these reports fabricated by Jews following the footsteps of Ibn Saba™? Were they the plots of the Dajj˜l conveyed to the R˜-˚dah through his network of shay˜t˙n? Were they revealed to the R˜˚dah by the shay˜t˙n as dreams? Allah knows best.12Conclusionˇese are the R˜˚dah. Initiated by a sly Jew, they are an apostate sect drowning in worship of the dead, cursing the best companions and wives of the Prophet , spreading doubt on the very basis of the religion (the Qur™˜n and the Sunnah), defaming the very honor of the Prophet , and preferring their ﬁtwelveﬂ im˜ms to the prophets and even to Allah! ˇeir hordes of followers all partake in the apostasy of their heads and leaders. Accordingly, there is no di˛er-ence between a layman R˜˚d˙ and a ﬁscholarﬂ except in the diseased hearts of the jih˜d claimants, as the R˜˚dah did not only reject Abˆ Bakr and ‚Umar, they also rejected Is-lam and the very basis of the religion. And throughout his-tory, they have never hesitated to cooperate with the Jews, Christians, and pagans against Islam and the Muslims.ˇus, the R˜˚dah are mushrik apostates who must be killed wherever they are to be found, until no R˜˚d˙ walks on the face of earth, even if the jih˜d claimants despise such and even if the jih˜d claimants defend the R˜˚dah with their words day and night. ˇe R˜˚dah and their founder Ibn Saba™ hated the khulaf˜™ of the Muslims, spread strife amongst their ranks, encouraged dissent, and waged war against the historic khil˜fah all in the name of ﬁcommand-ing the good and forbidding the evil,ﬂ a trait the jih˜d claimants also share with the R˜˚dah. It is therefore not surprising that the jih˜d claimants now wage war against the Islamic State while condemning the targeting of R˜˚d˙ temples, markets, and neighborhoods.Finally, the R˜˚dah await the Jewish Dajj˜l, who they plot to support alongside the Jews against the Muslims. ˇus, as the signs of the Hour approach, a Muslim should ignore the confusion spread by the callers to Hell˚re and instead Œ while performing jih˜d Œ re˘ect upon the condition of the R˜˚dah, those who imitate them, and those who defend them, and thereafter ask Allah to keep his heart ˚rm upon Islam, protect him from the evil of the Dajj˜l and all other ˚tnah, and enlighten his heart with truth, until he meets Allah while He is pleased with him.12   For more traits of the R˜˚d˙ ﬁmahd˙,ﬂ see D˜biq, issue 11, ﬁˇe ‚Mahd˙™ of the R˜˚dah: ˇe Dajj˜l.ﬂR˚˛d˙ religious occasions are celebra-tions of kufr and heresy46IN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMYIn an issue of ﬁTIMEﬂ magazine released shortly after the blessed attacks in Paris, Michael Morell Œ former deputy director of the CIA who also served twice as its acting direc-tor Œ wrote an article titled ﬁWhat Comes Next, And How Do We Handle It?

Yes indeed, the Islamic State had struck once again in the American homeland.Nonetheless, the crusader Michael Morell had the follow-ing to say in his article:46IN THE WORDS OF THE ENEMYThe crusader, Michael Morell, for-mer deputy director of the CIA47ﬁISIS poses a major threat to the U.S. and to U.S. interests abroad, and that threat is growing every day. ˇe nature and signi˚cance of the threat ˘ow from the fact that ISIS is Œ all at the same time Œ a terrorist group, a state and a revolutionary political movement. We have never faced an adversary like it.ﬂﬁAs a terrorist group, ISIS poses a threat to the homeland. ˇat threat is largely indirect and involves ISIS™s ability to radicalize young Americans to conduct attacks here. ˇe FBI has over 900 open investigations into homegrown ex-tremists, the vast majority radicalized by ISIS, and a large number of those investigations relate to individuals who may be plotting here–ﬂﬁ[T]he potential exists for the quantity of – [homegrown] attacks to be large. ˇe number of ISIS followers dwarfs the number of followers that al-Qaeda ever had. Over time, the indirect threat, if not signi˚cantly degraded, will become a direct one Œ that is, ISIS will have the ability to plan and direct attacks on the homeland from the group™s safe havens in Iraq and Syria, just like it did in Paris.ﬂﬁSuch attacks are deeply concerning because they carry the potential to be much more sophisticated and complex Œ and therefore more dangerous Œ than homegrown attacks, again, just like in Paris recently, or London in 2005 or even 9/11. And in news that should get everyone™s atten-tion, ISIS has shown an interest in weapons of mass de-struction.ﬂﬁˇe attacks in Paris were the ˚rst manifestation of an e˛ort by ISIS to put together an attack capability in Europe Œ an e˛ort it began less than a year ago. ˇe head of the U.K.™s domestic security agency recently warned that ISIS is now planning mass-casualty attacks in Britain. His concerns are well-founded. We will not be far behind.ﬂﬁAs a state, ISIS poses a threat to regional stability Œ a threat to the very territorial integrity of the current nation-states, a threat to in˘ame the entire region in sectarian war–ﬂﬁAs a revolutionary political movement, ISIS is gaining af-˚liates among extremist groups around the world. ˇey are signing up for what ISIS desires as its objective: a global caliphate where day-to-day life is governed by extreme reli-gious views. In the mind of ISIS, its global caliphate would extend to the U.S.ﬂﬁWhen they join ISIS, these a˝liates evolve from focusing on local issues to focusing on establishing an extension of the caliphate. And their targets evolve from local to interna-tional ones. ˇis is the story of the bombing of the Russian airline by an ISIS group in the Egyptian Sinai.ﬂﬁISIS has gained a˝liates faster than al-Qaeda ever did. From none a year ago, there are now militant groups that have sworn allegiance to ISIS in nearly 20 countries. ˇey have conducted attacks that have killed Americans, and they carry the potential to grab large amounts of territory–ﬂMorell ended his article saying:ﬁMr. President, the downing of the Russian airliner and the attacks in Paris make it crystal clear that our ISIS strategy is not working.ﬂYes, the crusader strategy is not working because the Islam-ic State is here to stay. It is a state that in˘icts just terror against its in˚del, pagan, and apostate enemies. And it will continue to expand until its banner ˘utters over Constan-tinople and Rome. Until then, let the crusaders get used to the sound of explosion and the image of carnage in their very own homelands.San Bernardino was not the ˛rst, and by Allah™s permission it will not be the last484849˛is month, D˜biq interviewed the W˜l˚ of Khur˜s˜n Shaykh H˜˙dh Sa™˚d Kh˜n (ha˙dhahull˜h) and asked him several questions regarding the Wil˜yah and the situation on the ground there. We present the interview below.D˜biq: How is the situation in Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n? Does the Islamic State have territory there with tamk˙n (consol-idation)? Are the visible aspects of tamk˙n there similar to what is manifest in Sh˜m and Iraq?˛e W˜l˚: Alhamdulill˜h, the situation in Khur˜s˜n brings good tidings, by Allah™s permission. We have achieved tamk˙n in the Wil˜yah, but not on the same level as Iraq and Sh˜m in terms of the magnitude of territory on the ground. ˇe lands of Khur˜s˜n are very vast and include ﬁAfghanistan,ﬂ western ﬁPakistan,ﬂ and other lands that the murtadd˙n had taken over. We have conquered and gained consolidation in ˚ve ﬁadministrative regionsﬂ here, walham-dulill˜h, and in terms of the visible aspects of tamk˙n, we Œ by Allah™s grace Œ establish Allah™s law therein and im-plement the hudˆd. We have established judicial courts in these regions, o˝ces for hisbah, o˝ces for zak˜h, and oth-ers for education, da™wah and mas˜jid, and public services. We set up a speci˚c division for every shar™˙ and adminis-trative duty therein and appointed quali˚ed and specialized o˝cials based on the personnel available from amongst the muh˜jir˙n and ans˜r in the Wil˜yah.D˜biq: What is the importance of Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n to Is-lam and the Muslims? What are the di˝culties the Wil˜yah faces?˛e W˜l˚: Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n has great importance to Is-lam and the Muslims. It had once been under the author-ity of the Muslims, along with the regions surrounding it. Afterwards, the secularist and R˜˚d˙ murtadd˙n conquered some of these regions, and the cow-worshipping Hindus and atheist Chinese conquered other nearby regions, as is the case in parts of Kashmir and Turkistan. So the Wil˜yah, by Allah™s permission, is a gate to re-conquering all these regions until they are ruled once more by Allah™s law, and so the territory of the blessed Khil˜fah is expanded.Also, the people of Khur˜s˜n in general love Islam and war-fare, and because of this, the region has a dormant force for supporting tawh˙d and jih˜d. ˇus, as the reality of the Khil˜fah becomes more clear to the people of Khur˜s˜n, they will join the Wil˜yah at a greater rate and strengthen its jih˜d against the enemies of Islam and the Muslims, includ-ing the ku˛˜r, the murtadd˙n, and those who ally with them inside and outside the region. As such, they will be a strong building block for the Khil˜fah in this part of the world. And the coming generations will be raised upon the Book and the Sunnah from a young age. ˇis is a tremendous grace that has reached this region by way of this khil˜fah, which is upon the prophetic methodology, and by way of our im˜m and khal˙fah, Abˆ Bakr al-Baghd˜d˙ al-Qurash˙.As for the di˝culties, then they are nothing but the t˜ghˆt enemies of Allah Œ including ﬁPakistanﬂ on one side, and ﬁAfghanistanﬂ on the other Œ standing with their armies and intelligence agencies against Islam, its khil˜fah, and the wil˜yah that represents it and implements its methodolo-gy in the region. ˇese two governments attempt to cre-ate many problems in order to obstruct the jih˜d of the Wil˜yah and thereby hinder the establishment of Islam and its methodology in the region. ˇey attempt to stop the expansion of the Khil˜fah. Such is also the condition of those organizations that these two governments produce, support, or take advantage of, and to whom they extend aid, and for whom they pave the way. ˇis leads these or-ganizations, such as the nationalist Taliban movement, to instigate various problems in order to wage war against the Khil˜fah. But how impossible it is for all these organizations and others to extinguish the light of Allah! For this is a kh-il˜fah that rose upon the prophetic methodology and upon the foundation of tawh˙d, thus all these taw˜gh˙t together will not be able to stand before its lions Œ the lions of tawh˙d and ‚aq˙dah. ˇe taw˜gh˙t succeeded against the ﬁIslamicﬂ organizations and movements that held ˘imsy creeds and de˚cient methodologies, whether they were ﬁda™wahﬂ-ori-ented or ﬁjih˜dﬂ-oriented. As for the Khil˜fah, it is a thorn Œ rather, an axe! Œ in the necks of the ku˛˜r and murtadd˙n in this region, by Allah™s power and strength.D˜biq: Does the nationalist Taliban movement have areas of consolidation in Khur˜s˜n? And do they rule them by Allah™s law?˛e W˜l˚: ˇe nationalist Taliban movement only has control of some regions of ﬁAfghanistan,ﬂ nowhere else. As for ruling them by Allah™s law, then it does not do that. Rather, they rule by tribal customs and judge a˛airs in ac-cordance with the desires and traditions of the people, tra-The hisbah in Wil˚yat Khur˚s˚n leveling graves50ditions opposing the Islamic Shar˙™ah. Wall˜hul-musta™˜n.D˜biq: What is Akhtar Mansour™s relationship with the Pa-kistani intelligence?˛e W˜l˚: Akhtar Mansour and his associates have strong and deep ties with Pakistani intelligence, and they live in the most important cities of ﬁPakistan,ﬂ such as Islamabad, Peshawar, and Quetta. Rather, even Akhtar Mansour™s ad-visory council contains members from the Pakistani intel-ligence! On top of that, Pakistani intelligence aids him in everything he does. His ties to the Pakistani intelligence agency ﬁISIﬂ became clear when its former head, the mur-tadd retired general Hamid Gul passed away several months ago Œ that general who Pakistani intelligence hired to man-age the ﬁIslamicﬂ organizations so that they would be sub-missive to the interests of the local and global taw˜gh˙t. When this general died, Akhtar Mansour gave the greatest condolences over his death out of loyalty to Pakistani intel-ligence and in recognition of everything they™ve done for him and for his Taliban movement. He stated in his con-dolences over Gul™s death, ﬁWith the death of Mull˜ ‚Umar one of our arms was severed, but with the death of General Hamid Gul we feel that the other arm has been severed. ˇe death of General Hamid Gul is no less in any way than the adversity we su˛ered with the parting of Mull˜ ‚Umar.ﬂ He also added, ﬁFollowing the death of Mull˜ ‚Umar, he [General Hamid Gul] played an important role in unifying the Taliban.ﬂAnd on the orders of these intelligence agencies, this enemy of Allah ˚ghts and kills the soldiers of the Wil˜yah, because the Wil˜yah is at war with the t˜ghˆt of ﬁPakistan.ﬂ Add to this that he has ties with Iranian intelligence, and with its support, he is active in obstructing the people from Islam and hindering the expansion of the Khil˜fah. And through all that, he defends the taw˜gh˙t of ﬁPakistanﬂ and ﬁAfghan-istanﬂ as well as the R˜˚dah.D˜biq: What is the war situation between the Islamic State and the Taliban, and between the Islamic State and the gov-ernments and armies of the murtadd˙n in ﬁPakistanﬂ and ﬁAfghanistanﬂ that are allied with the crusaders?˛e W˜l˚: ˇe war between us and the Taliban carries on. ˇe nationalist Taliban movement initiated the combat by attacking the muwahhid˙n. But the Wil˜yah repelled their aggression and the Taliban then ˘ed many of their strategic areas. ˇus victory Œ by Allah™s grace Œ was for the Wil˜yah.As for the condition of the war against the governments and armies of apostasy in Khur˜s˜n that are allied with the crusaders, then the jih˜d against the Pakistani and Afghan armies of apostasy is continuing and is proceeding with force, by Allah™s grace, power, and strength. ˇe muj˜hid˙n bravely carry on in ˚ghting the armies of both apostate governments and their forces who have betrayed Allah, His Messenger , and the Muslims.D˜biq: Do the muh˜jir˙n continue to make hijrah to Khu-r˜s˜n?˛e W˜l˚: Yes, the Muslims are making hijrah to the land of Khur˜s˜n in multitudes, walhamdulill˜h. We ask Allah to accept their hijrah from them and to support the Khil˜-fah, raise high the word of truth, and vanquish the word of falsehood through them.We, on our part, receive Œ with great welcome Œ every Mus-lim who makes hijrah to the Wil˜yah, and we help him to the best of our ability with everything with which Allah has provided us by His grace.It is upon every Muslim who wants to support the Shar˙™ah to hasten in making hijrah to this wil˜yah or to one of the other wil˜y˜t of the Khil˜fah, for it is their land, the land of Islam. It is upon them to make hijrah in order to escape from the humiliation of the Duny˜ and the punishment of the Hereafter, and to leave the camp of falsehood and enter the camp of truth wherein there is no falsehood. We wel-come them all and do not di˛erentiate between a muh˜jir and others, for the believers are brothers between whom there is no di˛erence except through taqw˜. ˇe muh˜jir is more beloved to us than our own selves, and Allah™s law is established here, walhamdulill˜h, so the muh˜jir will thereby protect his religion, himself, his honor, his wealth, and his mind, and support the religion of Allah with what he has of knowledge and experience. I repeat that it is not appropriate for a Muslim man or woman to delay from making hijrah. ˇey should not delay in manifesting their loyalty to the Muslims and the Khil˜fah.INTERVIEW51D˜biq: What is the situation of the Uzbeki muj˜hid broth-ers following their bay™ah to the Khal˙fah? Is there ˚ghting now between them and the nationalist Taliban movement?˛e W˜l˚: ˇe Uzbek muj˜hid brothers gave bay™ah to the Khal˙fah with sincerity, and they are muj˜hid˙n who are truthful in their jih˜d, walhamdulill˜h. We consider them as such, and Allah is their judge. However, the treacher-ous, deviant, nationalist Taliban movement began ˚ghting them on the 25th of Muharram, and this cruel movement didn™t care that the Uzbek brothers had made hijrah for the cause of Allah. So a number of the Uzbek brothers were martyred and wounded because of the Taliban™s criminal assault against them, and the Taliban movement increased in its tyranny and criminality by purposely kill-ing their defenseless women and children, with the move-ment™s ˚ghters executing them, sparing no one they could ˚nd. And there is no power or strength except with Allah. ˇey killed them for no sin, but only because they de-clared their support for the Shar˙™ah and their war against the taw˜gh˙t.D˜biq: Does the nationalist Taliban movement continue to allow farmers to sell opium? How is the Wil˜yah dealing with this serious phenomenon?˛e W˜l˚: ˇere™s no doubt that the nationalist Taliban movement has permitted farmers and merchants to grow and sell opium. Rather, the matter has reached the point that the movement itself harvests opium, and even worse than that is that the Taliban themselves transport opium and heroin in their personal vehicles, charging a fee to the sellers and the addicts! ˇey also take a 10% cut as well as taxes from them. Akhtar Mansour himself is considered as being from the major dealers of these narcotics.As for the Wil˜yah Œ walhamdulill˜h Œ then it has not only banned the growth and sale of opium, but has also banned in its territory everything that Allah™s law has prohibited, such as cigarettes and similar substances. So anywhere the men of hisbah ˚nd these prohibited items and narcotics in the lands the muj˜hid˙n have liberated, they gather them and burn them. And more important than that is uphold-ing tawh˙d, and doing so is the greatest priority of the men of hisbah. ˇus, they destroy all shrines and make the graves level with the ground, walhamdulill˜h.D˜biq: Did you suspect that Mull˜ ‚Umar was dead? What is the reason that you doubted he was still alive? What is the reason behind Akhtar Mansour and his associates conceal-ing the matter of his death?˛e W˜l˚: We believed for a long time that Mull˜ ‚Umar wasn™t alive, and that was because eight years ago we be-gan noticing changes and deviations in the disposition of the Taliban as well as in their deeds and o˝cial statements. ˇey began to leave o˛ implementation of the Shar˙™ah in the regions they controlled. We also noticed the Taliban™s inclination towards negotiating with the apostate govern-ment, and in this respect, the movement opened an o˝ce for itself in Qatar, declared its recognition of the nationalist borders drawn out by the crusaders, built strong ties with Pakistani intelligence, and began moving freely in the Pa-kistani regions. All of these matters indicated that Mull˜ ‚Umar was no longer alive. We also noticed that no one was able to meet him during this period, and no one had seen a video of him or heard any recording of his voice giving orders and otherwise on matters of war or anything con-cerning the land.We also noticed that Taliban began lifting the ban on sub-stances prohibited by the pure Shar˙™ah, making these sub-stances permissible for themselves and the people. ˇey began taking taxes and 10% cuts on these prohibited sub-stances. All of this indicated the passing away of Mull˜ ‚Umar.We then began investigating the matter, whereby import-ant and senior ˚gures attempted to meet with Mull˜ ‚Umar but to no avail. After many attempts to reach him by some of the truthful muj˜hid˙n from amongst our companions, they managed to meet with some members of his close and immediate family, who told them with all bluntness and clarity that Mull˜ ‚Umar was no longer alive!52As for the reason for Akhtar Mansour™s concealment of the news of Mull˜ ‚Umar™s death, his goal was to sideline some people and promote his friends and likes to rule ﬁAfghani-stanﬂ and manage the war in accordance with what he him-self desires and in accordance with what is desired by Paki-stani intelligence, which stands behind him, working in the shadows. So he thereby attempted to distance the truthful people away from leadership and away from administering the a˛airs of the Muslims in the region speci˚cally and that of the Muslim Ummah in general. Rather, he wouldn™t have any problem killing the truthful muj˜hid˙n, and he would attribute all the matters and o˝cial statements during that period to Mull˜ ‚Umar so that the people would submit to them. And throughout all that, he would present himself as Mull˜ ‚Umar™s deputy. So he would mislead the people in this evil manner and carry out anything he wished! ˇus Œ through his cunning and evil Œ he was able to utilize the concealment of Mull˜ ‚Umar™s death to do what his shayt˜n dictated to him, such as declaring his recognition of the nationalist, crusader borders, opening an o˝ce in an apos-tate t˜ghˆt state as he did in Qatar, resorting to scandalous negotiations, developing strong ties with Pakistani intelli-gence, and ˚nally, starting a war against the Khil˜fah. And all this he would do in the name of Mull˜ ‚Umar.D˜biq: What was the reaction of the soldiers and leaders of the Taliban, and the tribes allied to them, towards the news of Mull˜ ‚Umar™s death being concealed?˛e W˜l˚: In reality, and by Allah™s grace, following the news of Mull˜ ‚Umar™s death, a large number of the Taliban split o˛ from Akhtar Mansour and most of them joined the Kh-il˜fah in Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n. Many others also split o˛ and created their own groups, as was done by the one referred to as ﬁMuhammad Rasˆl.ﬂ Other large groups also split o˛ from the movement and remained without ˚ghting or activ-ity. All this occurred because the Taliban movement deviated signi˚cantly from what it was upon in its past. ˇe Taliban movement has now become a hostage and a plaything in the hands of others who steer it as they wish, as Akhtar Mansour concealed the news of Mull˜ ‚Umar™s death, took advantage of the concealment, and used the name of Mull˜ ‚Umar to steer the movement towards his despicable goals and in ac-cordance with the orders and instructions of the Pakistani intelligence.D˜biq: What is the di˛erence between Taliban ﬁAfghan-istanﬂ and Taliban ﬁPakistan,ﬂ whether in methodology or in terms of their relationships with the taw˜gh˙t and intelligence agencies? Are there Taliban factions allied to the Afghan government and others allied to the Pakistani government? What is their role on the ground in regards to treachery? And are Taliban ﬁPakistanﬂ a part of Taliban ﬁAfghanistanﬂ?˛e W˜l˚: ˇere used to be a di˛erence between the two Talibans, but now there™s no longer any di˛erence other than in their names and in other super˚cial issues. Both of the Talibans now don™t implement the Shar˙™ah. Rather, they both follow the desires of the people and both ˚ght while taking and obeying orders from others. ˇere were many sincere individuals in the Taliban ﬁPakistanﬂ move-ment waging jih˜d in order to raise high the word of Al-lah, in order to implement His pure Shar˙™ah. But after the establishment of the Khil˜fah, all the truthful muj˜hid˙n in the movement joined the Khil˜fah and gave bay™ah to the Khal˙fah, and therefore there is no one left in Taliban ﬁPakistanﬂ except for corrupters. Because of that, the two Talibans aren™t di˛erent from each other except that Taliban ﬁAfghanistanﬂ ˚ghts against Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n while taking The nationalist Taliban engage in peace talks with the taw˚gh˙t of Af-ghanistanINTERVIEW53orders directly from Pakistani intelligence. Furthermore, there are now various factions in Taliban ﬁPakistan.ﬂ For example, the Taliban ﬁPakistanﬂ branch that follows Fad-lull˜h has given bay™ah to Akhtar Mansour. In other words, they™ve given bay™ah to the Pakistani intelligence!D˜biq: Does al-Q˜™idah have any presence in Khur˜s˜n fol-lowing the deaths of most of its leadership? What is the or-ganization™s role in the war against the Khil˜fah inside and outside Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n?˛e W˜l˚: Al-Q˜™idah no longer has a real presence in Khu-r˜s˜n apart from the presence of only a few of its mem-bers. ˇey are individuals who have no ability to ˚ght the Wil˜yah, but spare no e˛ort in spreading misconceptions against the Khil˜fah and against its Wil˜yah in Khur˜s˜n and inciting the people against giving bay™ah and support-ing the Khil˜fah. Al-Q˜™idah has collapsed in a very big way here in its center and former stronghold. ˇere no longer remains any di˛erence between it and the Pakistani intelli-gence-a˝liated Taliban ﬁAfghanistan,ﬂ as the organization™s leader Ayman adh-Dhaw˜hir˙ has given bay™ah to Akhtar Mansour recently. As such, Akhtar Mansour became a lead-er issuing orders and Ayman adh-Dhaw˜hir˙ became a fol-lower receiving orders. ˇere is no di˛erence between the two groups. Both ultimately fall under the authority of the Pakistani intelligence, and both are against the Khil˜fah and its Wil˜yah in Khur˜s˜n, and in reality, against Islam.D˜biq: As you know, there is a presence of R˜˚dah in Khur˜s˜n. How did they come to Khur˜s˜n? Does Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n conduct military and security operations against them?˛e W˜l˚: ˇere have been R˜˚dah in Khur˜s˜n Œ sadly Œ for a long time, and they are far from our areas of control. We have fought them and we regularly conduct operations against them, such as the operation conducted in the begin-ning of Muharram in the city of Kabul. We likewise con-ducted a major operation in Karachi against the Ism˜™˙l˙ sect in which 48 of the evil R˜˚dah were killed.D˜biq: Is the Islamic State capable of expanding to Kash-mir to ˚ght the cow-worshipping Hindus and the murtad-d˙n from the apostate factions allied to the taw˜gh˙t of Pa-kistan, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba for example?˛e W˜l˚: In reality, we™ve seen before how the taw˜gh˙t of Pakistan, and speci˚cally their army and intelligence, would exploit the various ﬁIslamicﬂ organizations on the issue of Kashmir for their despicable personal interests. ˇey also exploited the zeal of the people of Kashmir for the sake of their own interests, not out of any concern for the a˛airs of the Muslims, nor for the sake of establishing Allah™s law in the land. And how would they establish Allah™s law over there when they don™t even establish it in their own lands! So when the ﬁmaslahahﬂ (preservation of their interests) re-quired that they cease˚re, withdraw, and retreat, the intelli-gence agencies left the people of Kashmir in the middle of the road and in the worst of situations. ˇe degree of Paki-stani ﬁinterestsﬂ always ˘uctuates back and forth, doing so especially in the last years, until the people of Kashmir hit a roadblock and there was no one to save them from the quag-mire into which they were thrown. Because of this, many of the people of Kashmir and the soldiers of the factions left and made hijrah to Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n, walhamdulill˜h. ˇus, there™s a big opportunity, with Allah™s permission, to establish the religion of Allah there and for the Islamic State to expand to it. ˇere are speci˚c arrangements in those regions and the Muslims will soon hear pleasant news about the Khil˜fah™s expansion to those lands, insh˜™all˜h.ˇe apostate factions and agents of the taw˜gh˙t of ﬁPaki-stan,ﬂ such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, do not have control over any territory in the regions of Kashmir, because they proceed in accordance with the orders of the Pakistani intelligence, as they are the ones who direct their work, pushing them forward when they wish and pulling them back when they wish. ˇey also conceal their work when they wish, depend-ing on the local and global atmosphere and based on per-sonal material interests, without any consideration for the interests of the Muslims in Kashmir.D˜biq: Do you have any advice for the Muslims in general, and the Muslims in the Khil˜fah in speci˚c?˛e W˜l˚: Yes, I say to them: O Muslims, O my brothers for the sake of Allah, fear Allah concerning yourselves and have mercy on yourselves. Look around, all the sects of kufr and atheism as well as the sects of apostasy have gathered. ˇey have gathered against the Muslims. ˇey do not leave the Muslims to practice the religion in its entirety and thus become completely for Allah. Rather, they leave them to practice some of its acts of worship such as the prayer, the The murtadd leader of Lash-kar-e-Taiba54Hajj, and the zak˜h. ˇey don™t want the Muslims to rule all aspects of their lives based on the commands and prohibi-tions of Allah. ˇerefore, I advise you that just as the ku˛˜r and murtadd˙n have gathered against you to prevent you from establishing your religion, to move Islam out of their way, and end it– I advise you for the sake of Allah to unite and gather against the world of kufr, apostasy, and atheism. Allah has prohibited division in His clear-cut revelation and has commanded adherence to the Jam˜™ah and to hold ˚rm-ly to His strong rope. {And hold ˚rmly to the rope of Allah all together and ‚Imr˜n: 103]. ˇerefore, unite and gather by the order of Allah who or-dered us not to become divided. Unite so that you don™t lose your strength and thus fail. Just as Allah prohibited shirk, fornication, consuming what is har˜m, and so on with His words, Allah has also strongly prohibited division. And it is not allowed for a Muslim to believe in parts of the Book and disbelieve in other parts.ˇe Khil˜fah is an extremely signi˚cant matter in Allah™s law. It builds unity between the Muslims and prevents di-vision. It also steers their a˛airs. Likewise, the solutions to all the issues of the Ummah lie in the establishment of the Khil˜fah. Allah has now bestowed it upon us out of His tre-mendous favor and grace. So be thankful for Allah™s blessing and He will increase it for you, and the ˚rst aspect of show-ing thankfulness is to recognize His blessing and head to the land of the Khil˜fah. ˇerefore, I call on all the Muslims on the face of the earth and say to them: Come forth to strengthen and unify the ranks of the Muslims. Come forth to support Allah™s religion revealed from above the seven heavens. Come forth to aid the Khil˜fah upon the prophet-ic methodology. Come forth to give bay™ah to your khal˙fah and im˜m who looks after your a˛airs. Come forth, and let every one of you give what he has to o˛er. Come forth to ˚ght the ku˛˜r, mushrik˙n, and murtadd˙n, and to drive out their falsehood, which has committed haughty and gross tyranny in the land. And do not listen to any barking that misleads you away and distances you from the right Allah has blessed you with. You see and hear how they disparage the Khil˜fah and its soldiers and make accusations against them, as is the habit of every stubborn k˜˚r, deviant heretic, and murtadd. ˇey accuse its soldiers sometimes of being Takf˙riyy˙n and other times of being Khaw˜rij. You see and hear how the murtadd Pakistani media, which serves as an agent of the Jews and Christians, accuses the muj˜hid˙n of Wil˜yat Khur˜s˜n Œ without the least bit of shame and without any evidence Œ of being agents of the Indian intel-ligence. All these barkers do so out of their enmity towards Allah™s religion, for the sake of Shayt˜n, and to distort the reputation of the Khil˜fah and its muj˜hid˙n in order to mislead the common Muslims so that they don™t head for their blessed state gifted to them by Allah. ˇe misleading deviant ﬁscholarsﬂ even left their corrupt fat˜w˜ that had been directed against ˚ghting the ku˛˜r and murtadd˙n who wage war against the religion and its noble method-ology and instead directed the attention of their disgraceful fat˜w˜ towards those who are establishing Islam and elevat-ing the tower of the Khil˜fah. So do not concern yourself with these various barkers barking from their dumps. Go, with the blessing of Allah, to your Khil˜fah, and do not fear the blame of the critics concerning Allah. As for my advice to the Muslims in the Khil˜fah speci˚-cally, I say to them: Congratulations on this blessing from Allah, the blessing of the Khil˜fah which your Lord and God has bestowed upon you, for indeed Allah has granted you a great gift, so do not forget this mercy and this tre-mendous favor. Indeed, we were waiting for it impatiently and anxiously throughout our entire past jih˜d. So don™t deny this precious blessing. Ful˚ll its right and always be thankful for it. Adorn yourselves with a virtuous and noble character and with good deeds, ˚rstly so that Allah will be pleased with us for doing so, and secondly so that it can be a means of calling all people to Allah™s religion, and so that those astray and misguided can follow you and ˚nd what they™re seeking through your character, your deeds, and your upright behavior. ˇey would thus see the reality of the Khil˜fah and its importance to them and to all Mus-lims, and would then take revenge for it and support Allah™s religion through it. ˇis e˛ort would also be a means of calling to the reality of the manhaj of the Khil˜fah, where the Muslim shades himself and wherein he ˚nds all manner of good, safety, and security. And so it can be a means of calling the ku˛˜r to accept Islam and rest under the shade of the Khil˜fah. I also advise my Muslims brothers in the Khil˜fah to exert everything they possess in terms of e˛ort and jih˜d, and to sacri˚ce everything precious and dear to them, and to not spare any e˛ort, even if it™s small, and to do all that for the sake of strengthening their Khil˜fah, and to not disobey Allah openly or in secret Œ for blessings are reduced and taken away due to sins Œ and to work hard to direct all aspects of their lives in accordance with the Book and the Sunnah, and to not violate any of the Khal˙fah™s orders so that Allah does not become angry with them. {O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you} [An-Nis˜™: 59].INTERVIEWThe Uzbek muj˚hid˙n in Khur˚s˚n give bay™ah to Am˙rul-Mu™min˙n5556
